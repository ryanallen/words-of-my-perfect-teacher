Also known as Padmasambhava, the Lotus-born, he is the "Second Buddha" who established Buddhism in Tibet. He is shown here in the form known as "Prevailing Over Appearances and Existence" (Nangsi Zilnon), the name meaning that, as he understands the nature of everything that appears, he is naturally the master of all situations.

<h1 id="islt" align="center">INTERNATIONAL SACRED LITERATURE TRUST</h1>

The International Sacred Literature Trust was established to promote understanding and open discussion between and within faiths and to give voice in today's world to the wisdom that speaks across time and traditions.

What resources do the sacred traditions of the world possess to respond to the great global threats of poverty, war, ecological disaster and spiritual despair?

Our starting-point is the sacred texts with their vision of a higher truth and their deep insights into the nature of humanity and the universe we inhabit. The translation programme is planned so that each faith community articulates its own teachings with the intention of enhancing its self-understanding as well as the understanding of those of other faiths and those of no faith.

The Trust particularly encourages faiths to make available texts which are needed in translation for their own communities and also texts which are little known outside the tradition but which have the power to inspire, console, enlighten and transform. These sources from the past become resources for the present and future when we make inspired use of them to guide us in shaping the contemporary world.

Our religious traditions are diverse but, as with the natural environment, we are discovering the global interdependence of human hearts and minds. The Trust invites all to participate in the modern experience of interfaith encounter and exchange which marks a new phase in the human quest to discover our full humanity.

<h1 id="forewordhhdl" align="center">Foreword<br>by The Dalai Lama</h1>

Jig-me Gyal-wai Nyu-gu, who was one of the eminent disciples of Jig-me Ling-pa, the exponent of Dzog-pa Chen-po Long-chen Nying-thig, gave an oral instruction on Long-chen Nying-thig and his disciple Dza Pal-trul Rinpoche transcribed it, giving it the title: KUNSANG LA-MAI ZHAL-LUNG.

It is said in the Great Perfection teachings that one cannot become enlightened through a contrived mind; rather, the basic mind is to be identified, in relation to which all phenomena are to be understood as the sport of the mind. One then familiarizes oneself continuously and one-pointedly with this ascertainment. However, to have a full understanding of this it is not not sufficient merely to read books; one needs the full preparatory practice of the Nying-ma system and, in addition, the special teaching of a qualified Nying-ma master as well as his blessings. The student must also have accumulated great merit. That is why great Nying-ma-pa masters like Jig-me Ling-pa and Do-drup-chen worked so hard.

Translation of such works containing the Dzog-chen preliminaries will be of immense value these days. I congratulate the Padmakara Translation Group for having produced this work in English and French. I am sure this authentic preliminary work will benefit all those who are interested in Dzog-chen.

*<p id="longchenpa">Longchenpa (1308-1363)</p>*
The most brilliant teacher of the Nyingma lineage. Longchen Rabjampa gathered together the Heart-essence teachings of Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra and Yeshe Tsogyol. he transmitted all these teachings to Jigme Lingpa in a series of visions as the Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse. 

---

<h1 id="forewordhhdkr" align="center">Foreword<br>by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche</h1>

*The Words of My Perfect Teacher, a Guide to the Preliminaries for the Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse from the Great Perfection*, sets out the paths of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism without any conflict between them.

It contains all the teachings, including the Steps of the Path for those of the three levels of understanding, along with the Three Main Themes of the Path; the Three Perceptions, preliminaries for the Path and Fruit; the Buddha Nature as the cause, precious human life as the support, the spiritual friend as the impetus, his instructions as the method, and the kayas and wisdoms as the result, these representing the confluence of the Kadampa and Mahamudra traditions; and the Nyingma path in terms of determination to be free through disgust for samsara, faith through confidence in the effect of actions, bodhicitta through striving to help others, and pure perception of the utter purity of everything there is.

For all teachings on all practices, whether preliminaries or main, this text is indispensable. That is why, at this fortunate time in which the [Buddha's](#buddha) precious doctrine is beginning to shine its light throughout the world, this book has been translated in the profound hope that&ndash;being of enormous worth and little danger, and covering as it does all the essential points of the path&ndash;all contact with it may be fruitful, and that it may become the object of study, reflection and meditation. That followers of Dharma teach or listen to this text is of great importance.
