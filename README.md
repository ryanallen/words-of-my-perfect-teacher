Also known as [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), the Lotus-born, he is the "Second Buddha" who established Buddhism in Tibet. He is shown here in the form known as "Prevailing Over Appearances and Existence" (Nangsi Zilnon), the name meaning that, as he understands the nature of everything that appears, he is naturally the master of all situations.

# INTERNATIONAL SACRED LITERATURE TRUST

The International Sacred Literature Trust was established to promote understanding and open discussion between and within faiths and to give voice in today's world to the wisdom that speaks across time and traditions.

What resources do the sacred traditions of the world possess to respond to the great global threats of poverty, war, ecological disaster and spiritual despair?

Our starting-point is the sacred texts with their vision of a higher truth and their deep insights into the nature of humanity and the universe we inhabit. The translation programme is planned so that each faith community articulates its own teachings with the intention of enhancing its self-understanding as well as the understanding of those of other faiths and those of no faith.

The Trust particularly encourages faiths to make available texts which are needed in translation for their own communities and also texts which are little known outside the tradition but which have the power to inspire, console, enlighten and transform. These sources from the past become resources for the present and future when we make inspired use of them to guide us in shaping the contemporary world.

Our religious traditions are diverse but, as with the natural environment, we are discovering the global interdependence of human hearts and minds. The Trust invites all to participate in the modern experience of interfaith encounter and exchange which marks a new phase in the human quest to discover our full humanity.

*<h1 id="forewordhhdl" align="center">Foreword<br>by The Dalai Lama</h1>*

Jig-me Gyal-wai Nyu-gu, who was one of the eminent disciples of Jig-me Ling-pa, the exponent of Dzog-pa Chen-po Long-chen Nying-thig, gave an oral instruction on Long-chen Nying-thig and his disciple Dza Pal-trul Rinpoche transcribed it, giving it the title: KUNSANG LA-MAI ZHAL-LUNG.

It is said in the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection) teachings that one cannot become enlightened through a contrived mind; rather, the basic mind is to be identified, in relation to which all phenomena are to be understood as the sport of the mind. One then familiarizes oneself continuously and one-pointedly with this ascertainment. However, to have a full understanding of this it is not not sufficient merely to read books; one needs the full preparatory practice of the Nying-ma system and, in addition, the special teaching of a qualified Nying-ma master as well as his blessings. The student must also have accumulated great merit. That is why great [Nying-ma-pa](#nyingmapa) masters like Jig-me Ling-pa and Do-drup-chen worked so hard.

Translation of such works containing the Dzog-chen preliminaries will be of immense value these days. I congratulate the Padmakara Translation Group for having produced this work in English and French. I am sure this authentic preliminary work will benefit all those who are interested in Dzog-chen.

*<p id="longchenpa-il">Longchenpa (1308-1363)</p>*
The most brilliant teacher of the [Nyingma](#nyingmapa) lineage. Longchen Rabjampa gathered together the Heart-essence teachings of [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), [Vimalamitra](#vimalamitra) and [Yeshe Tsogyol](#yeshe-tsogyal). He transmitted all these teachings to Jigme Lingpa in a series of visions as the Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse. 

---

*<h1 id="forewordhhdkr" align="center">Foreword<br>by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche</h1>*

*The Words of My Perfect Teacher, a Guide to the Preliminaries for the Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse from the Great Perfection*, sets out the paths of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism without any conflict between them.

It contains all the teachings, including the Steps of the Path for those of the three levels of understanding, along with the Three Main Themes of the Path; the Three Perceptions, preliminaries for the Path and Fruit; the [Buddha Nature](#buddha-nature) as the cause, precious human life as the support, the [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) as the impetus, his instructions as the method, and the [kayas](#kaya) and wisdoms as the result, these representing the confluence of the [Kadampa](#kadampa) and [Mahamudra](#mahamudra) traditions; and the [Nyingma](#nyingmapa) path in terms of determination to be free through disgust for [samsara](#samsara), faith through confidence in the effect of actions, bodhicitta through striving to help others, and pure perception of the utter purity of everything there is.

For all teachings on all practices, whether preliminaries or main, this text is indispensable. That is why, at this fortunate time in which the [Buddha's](#buddha) precious doctrine is beginning to shine its light throughout the world, this book has been translated in the profound hope that&mdash;being of enormous worth and little danger, and covering as it does all the essential points of the path&mdash;all contact with it may be fruitful, and that it may become the object of study, reflection and meditation. That followers of [Dharma](#dharma) teach or listen to this text is of great importance.

---

*<h1 id="acknowledgements" align="center">Translators' Acknowledgements</h1>*

In accordance with Tibetan tradition, the translators would like to thank the teachers of the lineage: the late Dudjom Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and Kangyur Rinpoche, whose extraordinary inspiration and patient explanations form the basis for all our efforts to understand these teachings; and also the numerous other [lamas](#lama) who answered our questions and gave us encouragement&mdash;Dodrup Chen Rinpoche, Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche, Dzogchen Khenpo Thubten, Zenkar Rinpoche, Khetsun Zangpo Rinpoche, Lama Sonam Tobgyal and many others.

The Padmakara Translation Group is made up of students of Tibetan Buddhism from several countries and disciplines, working under the direction of Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche, at the centre d'Etudes de Chanteloube in Dordogne, Southwest France.

The history of this particular project runs parallel to the evolution of the group, many of whose members began their study of Patrul Rinpoche's *Kunzang Lamai Shelung* in the mid seventies, both in India and in Europe. They were then taught in detail from it, as the basis for their own practice of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) path during the traditional meditation retreats which started in 1980 at Chanteloube. The text was translated into French by members of the group guided by their Tibetan teachers, and published as *Le Chemin de La Grande Perfection* by the newly-formed Editions Padmakara in 1987.

The first stage of the English version was a draft translation from the French by Michael Dickman. This was the starting point for a new translation from the original Tibetan. It was prepared, with many revisions, by Christian Bruyat, Charles Hastings and John Canti. Stephen Gethin provided editorial help and prepared the index.

The translators are grateful to readers Michal Abrams, Wulstan Fletcher, Helena Blankleder, Rinchen Lhamo, Elissa Mannheimer and Vivian Kurz for their valuable suggestions, and to Jill Heald for help with the typescript.

Finally, our warmest thanks to Kerry Brown of the International Sacred Literature Trust for her constant and patient encouragement.

*<h1 id="preface" align="center">Preface to the Second Edition</h1>*

  The encouraging need for this book to be reprinted has made possible a number of changes. A preface written by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche for the French edition has been included, as well as a postface written by Jamgon Kongtrul the Great for the very first woodblock printing of this book in Tibetan a century ago. The quality of the [illustrations](#listofillustrations) has been improved, the [notes](#notes) and [glossary](#glossary) have been expanded and revised, and Sanskrit words have been given their standard transliterated spelling.

  However, the principal change is a revision of the text itself, the fruit of a painstaking, detailed re-reading by Pema Wangyal Rinpoche. His numerous comments, clarifications and queries&mdash;on average three or four per page&mdash;have enabled us to take a critical look at the accuracy of our translation and to bring it closer still to Patrul Rinpoche's original meaning. Readers of the first edition may be assured that we have found no glaring errors in the substance of the instructions and practices explained. Nevertheless, in a text so justly celebrated for its extraordinary wealth of detail and anecdote, it is in those finer details that we hope the translation has gained in authenticity and accuracy.

No translation will ever be definitive. Our hope is that we may continue to improve the translation of this text in the future, particularly since&mdash;as testified by the many encouraging letters we have received from all over the world&mdash; it is used intensively by many individual readers and Buddhist groups as a tool for study and practice. Had time allowed, we would have liked to undertake a thorough revision of the endnotes in the light of a new translation of one of the principal sources from which they were compiled, Khenpo Ngawang Palzang's *Notes*, currently proceeding under the direction of Alak Zenkar (with the participation of several members of the Padmakara Translation Group, see bibliography). That, unfortunately, will have to await a third edition.

All the changes to this edition were compiled, edited and entered by John Canti, with valuable help from Maria Jesus Hervas, whose assiduous work in preparing a forthcoming Spanish translation uncovered a number of errors and omissions in the English, and from readers Helena Blankleder, Charles Hastings, Steven Gethin and Wulstan Fletcher.

Once again, we are grateful for the continuing interest and support of the Sacred Literature Trust and its successive directors, Paul Seto and Malcolm Gerratt&mdash;and especially for their patience, which the delays in the preparation of this second edition must have sorely tested.

*<h1 id="introduction" align="center">Translators' Introduction</h1>*

*The Words of My Perfect Teacher* is one of the best-loved introductions to the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism, constantly recommended by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other eminent teachers. It provides a detailed guide to the methods by which an ordinary person can transform his or her consciousness and set off on the path to Buddhahood, the state of awakening and freedom. The first half of the book contains a series of contemplations on the frustration and deep suffering of [samsara](#samsara), the round of existence based on ignorance and deluded emotions, and the enormous value of our human life, which provides a unique opportunity to attain Buddhahood. The second half explains the first steps of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana), the "Diamond Vehicle" whose powerful methods of transformation provide the distinctive character of the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism.

Patrul Rinpoche's work is not a treatise for experts but a manual of practical advice for anyone sincerely wishing to practice the [Dharma](#dharma). He wrote it in a style that could speak as easily to rough nomads and villagers as to lamas and monks. In fact he claimed that it was not really a literary composition at all, but that he had simply set down the oral instructions of his own teacher as he himself had heard them. The particular magic of the book is that we feel that we are Patrul Rinpoche's own students, listening to his heartfelt advice, based on the oral tradition that he received from his own teacher and the deep experience of years of practice.

He explains everything we need to know to practice the teachings&mdash;and also, often with devastating irony, the many mistakes that can be made on the spiritual journey. The language veers from high poetry to broad vernacular. Each point is illustrated by numerous quotations, down-to-earth examples from daily life, and a wealth of stories. Some of these stories go back to the very origins of Buddhism in the 6th century BC and beyond; some are drawn from the extraordinary lives of the great masters of India and Tibet; some concern the doings of the ordinary folk of Patrul Rinpoche's native Kham.

Patrul Rinpoche was famous for the direct way he probed the depths of this students' minds. He was a firm believer in [Atisa's](#atisa) dictum, **"The best [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) is the one who attacks your hidden faults."** Although his work is clearly adapted to his particular audience, with a little effort of transposition we can see that human nature remains remarkably the same regardless of time and culture. We feel that the recesses of our own character are exposed and we are forced to question our own habits of thought and open our minds to new possibilities.

In his concluding chapter the author describes his work as follows:

> In writing down these instructions I have not been guided primarily by aesthetic or literary considerations. My main aim has simply been to record faithfully the oral instructions of my revered teacher in a way that is easy to understand and useful for the mind. I have done my best not to spoil them by mixing in my own words or ideas. On separate occasions my teacher also used to give numerous special instructions for exposing hidden faults, and I have added whatever I have been able to remember of these in the most appropriate places. Do not take them as a window through which to observe others' faults, but rather as a mirror for examining your own. Look carefully within yourself to see whether or not you have those hidden faults. If you do, recognize them and take them out of their hiding place. Correct your mind and set it at ease on the right path...

For [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) Buddhism, enlightenment is not a remote ideal but something which, with the appropriate methods and a supreme effort, can be achieved here and now, in this very life. In Tibet's living wisdom tradition, every scripture, every meditation practice and training for the mind, is passed on from teacher to student, and then internalized till it becomes an integral part of that person's experience. One of the words for spiritual practice in Tibetan is *nyamlen*, literally "taking into experience." Someone who can be considered a lineage holder, a truly qualified spiritual teacher, must have actually attained realization. Patrul Rinpoche held a continuous line of transmission coming down from the Buddha himself. This lineage has been passed on unbroken, from one realized teacher to the next, until the present day.

Patrul Rinpoche's perfect teacher. Patrul Rinpoche heard his explanation of the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* many times, and claimed that *The Words of My Perfect Teacher* was nothing more or less than a faithful compendium of what he had heard on those different occasions.

## Patrul Rinpoche and the tradition he inherited

In the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) school, to which Patrul Rinpoche belonged, and which is the oldest tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, there are two kinds of transmission. There is the Kahma, (*bka' ma*) or oral lineage, passed on from teacher to student over the centuries, and there is the miraculous direct lineage of Terma (*gter ma*) or [Spiritual Treasures](#spiritual-treasure). These were hidden in the eighth century by [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana) and his great woman disciple [Yeshe Tshogyal](#yeshe-tsogyal), to be discovered in later ages at the appropriate moment. *The Words of My Perfect Teacher* is an explanation of the preliminary practices of the *Longchen Nyingtik* (*klong chen snying thig*), *The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse*, a [spiritual treasure](#spiritual-treasure) discovered by [Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) (1729 - 1798).

*<p id="jigme-gyalwai-nyugu-il" align="center">Jigme Gyalwai Nyugu</p>*
[Patrul Rinpoche's](#patrul-rinpoche-and-the-tradition-he-inherited) perfect teacher. Patrul Rinpoche heard his explanation of the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* many times, and claimed that *The Words of My Perfect Teacher* was nothing more or less than a faithful compendium of what he had heard on those different occasions.

[Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) was a prodigy who became immensely learned with almost no study, through arousing his wisdom mind in a series of long meditation retreats. He received the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* in a series of visions of [Longchenpa](#longchenpa), a great [lama](#lama) of the fourteenth century.

[Longchenpa](#longchenpa) systematized the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) doctrines in his astonishing *Seven Treasures* (*mdzod bdun*, see [bibliography](#bibliography)) and other works, which cover all aspects of the Buddhist teachings, and in particular discuss fully the subtleties of [Dzogchen, the Great Perfection](#great-perfection). He also wrote extensively on the teachings of the other schools, but these works have been lost. Although [Longchenpa](#longchenpa) lived several centuries before him, he was in fact [Jigme Lingpa's](#jigme-lingpa) principal teacher.

[Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) first practiced and mastered the teachings he had discovered, and then passed them on to a few close disciples who were capable of becoming pure holders of the doctrine. One of these was Patrul Rinpoche's teacher, Jigme Gyalwai Nyugu, who after spending a considerable time with [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) in central Tibet, returned to Kham (the eastern region of the country). There he undertook the practice of what [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) had taught him, living on a remote mountainside in a mere depression in the ground, without even a cave for shelter, and with only wild plants for food. He was indifferent to comfort and convenience, determined to let go of all worldly considerations and concentrate on the goal of ultimate realization. Gradually disciples gathered around him, living in tents on the windswept hillside. One of these was the young Patrul, who received from him, no less than fourteen times, the teachings contained in this book. Subsequently Patrul also studied with many other great [lamas](#lama) of the day, including the highly unconventional Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje, who directly introduced him to the nature of the mind.

Throughout his life Patrul Rinpoche emulated the uncompromising simplicity of his master. Although he had been recognized in his childhood as an incarnate [lama](#lama) or [*tulku*](#tulku)&mdash;his name is an abbreviation of Palgye Tulku&mdash;and would normally have had a high position in a monastic establishment, he spent his life wandering from place to place, camping in the open, in the guise of an ordinary beggar. If he was offered gold or silver he would often just leave it lying on the ground, thinking that wealth was only a source of trouble. Even when he had become a famous teacher, he would travel around unrecognized, living in the same simple and carefree manner. There is even a story of a [lama](#lama) he met on his travels who, thinking he was a good fellow who might benefit from such an extraordinary teaching, taught him this very text. On another occasion he traveled with a poor widow, helping her to cook and to take care of her children, carrying them on his back. When they arrived at their destination, Patrul Rinpoche excused himself, saying he had something important to do. The woman heard that the great Patrul Rinpoche was teaching at the monastery. She went there to watch, and was amazed to see her traveling companion on the throne instructing a vast assembly. At the end of the teaching he asked that all the offerings be given to her.

To his students he was immensely kind, but also immensely tough. He treated beggars and kins in exactly the same way. In all situations his only interest was to benefit others, and he would always say whatever would be most useful, regardless of social niceties.

## The stages of practice

*The Words of My Perfect Teacher* belongs to a category of literature known as "written guides" (*khrid yig*), which emulate and supplement the oral explanations needed to elucidate a meditation text. In this case the text in question is the preliminary practice of the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse*.

The *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* cycle of teachings that [Longchenpa](#longchenpa) passed on to [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) has become one of the most widely practiced in the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) school. It contains a complete [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) path, starting at the beginner stage with the preliminary practices (*sngon 'gro*). Then comes the main practice (*dngos gzhi*), which has three principal parts, the generation phase (*bskyed rim*) the perfection phase (*rdzogs rim*), and the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection) (*rdzogs pa chen po*).

The preliminary practices have an outer and an inner section, and our text is accordingly divided into two. The  first part, the ordinary or external preliminaries, deals with:  
1. the freedoms and advantages offered by human life
2. impermanence
3. the sufferings of [samsara](#samsara)
4. how [karma](#karma), the principle of cause and effect, applies to all our actions
5. the benefits of liberation and
6. how to follow a spiritual teacher.

These elements are fundamental for a proper understanding of Buddhist values. They are general because they are the fundamentals of Buddhism in general. The contemplations in this section can be practiced by anyone, Buddhist or not.

The second part, the inner preliminaries, starts with taking refuge&mdash;learning to rely on the Buddha, the [Dharma](#dharma) (his teaching) and the [Sangha](#sangha) (the Buddhist community). This is the basis of Buddhist commitment common to all traditions. Next comes the development of bodhicitta, the "mind of enlightenment." This attitude of unconditional love and compassion, that seeks to bring all beings to perfect freedom, is the basis of the [Mahayana](#mahayana). It is followed by practices to purify the effects of one's past negative actions and accumulate the positive energy necessary to progress on the path. These practices use more fully the techniques of visualization and mantra specific to the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) approach.

Finally comes the [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga), uniting one's mind with the mind of the teacher. [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga) is the very root of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana), where the purity of the link between teacher and disciple is of paramount importance. Also included here is the practice of *phowa*, or transference of consciousness, a shortcut method to enable those who are unable to pursue the path to the end to be liberated nonetheless at the time of death.

For the practices in Part Two, it is necessary to have the guidance of a qualified teacher. Indeed this is advisable for any spiritual practice. In pre-communist Tibet almost all Tibetans considered themselves Buddhists, and they would try to follow Buddhist ethics, make offerings and recite some prayers and [mantras](#mantra). This remains largely true even in occupied Tibet today. A smaller number of those who are Buddhists in this general sense then take the decision to pursue the spiritual journey actively, and it is such people who would undertake these practices, usually repeating each element one hundred thousand times.

Next comes the practices of the generation and perfection phases, culminating in the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection). In the Tibetan tradition the inner journey is mapped with astonishing precision. For each stage of the practice there are oral explanations and explanatory texts. [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is a science of the mind, in which an expert teacher fully understands the significance of each experience, and the solution for each error. Our present text does not go into the details of the rest of the path, but we shall give a brief overview here, to give an idea of the progression that follows on from the preliminaries.

### The preliminary practice

*The outer preliminaries* comprise the four contemplations which turn away from [samsara](#samsara).
*The inner preliminaries* are:
1. taking refuge
2. bodhicitta
3. purification through the practice of [Vajrasattva](#vajrasattva)
4. accumulation of merit through the offering of the [mandala](#mandala), and
4. [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga).

Sometimes there are additional elements, as in the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse*. The ritual text may be quite long or very short. This, however, is the general structure.

### The generation phase

In the generation phase one learns to develop and enlightened vision of the world by visualizing oneself as a [Buddha](#buddha), and one's surroundings as a pure [Buddhafield](#buddhafield), while reciting the appropriate [mantra](#mantra). This process is at first artificial, something which is developed or generated, but the visualizations correspond to the visionary experience of enlightened beings. By adopting these new habits of perception, one can weaken the ordinary habits of gross perception based on ignorance and emotional tendencies, and put oneself in touch with a more subtle level of experience. These practices take the form of *sadhanas*, the ritual texts for which are sometimes extraordinarily poetic.

### The perfection phase

Once the sacred vision has become a living experience, the perfection phase completes the process, taking it to a more interior level by working with the subtle energies of the body, through mastery of the breath, physical postures and other [yogas](#yoga).

### The Great Perfection

In the generation and perfection phases one acquires the illustrative wisdom (*dpe'i ye shes*) through meditation experiences which serve as pointers to indicate the ultimate nature of the mind. In Dzogchen&mdash;the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection)&mdash;the nature of the mind is introduced directly and suddenly by the teacher. This is an immediate experiential recognition of the [Buddha-nature](#buddha-nature) itself. The subsequent practice consists essentially in getting used to that experience and developing it in an increasingly vast way. Here one acquires real or absolute wisdom (*don gyi ye shes*), the direct experience of ultimate truth.

In a sense, each level of practice builds on the previous one, but at the same time it further strips away the layers of delusion, leaving an ever more denuded experience of reality. Each practice is also a complete path in itself, in which&mdash;for those who have the wisdom to see it&mdash;all the others are included. Even the preliminaries, and indeed the individual elements of the preliminaries, can, in themselves, constitute a complete path to enlightenment.

In particular, the [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga) is the essence of all paths. The teachers of the lineage often say that all practices should be done in the manner of [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga). Total openness and devotion to a realized teacher is the most sure and rapid way to progress.

Patrul Rinpoche expresses this capital importance of the spiritual teacher in the very title of this book, Kunzang Lamai Shelung, which we have freely translated as *The Words of My Perfect Teacher*.

Kunzang means "everywhere perfect" or "always perfect." It is the abbreviated form of Kuntuzangpo (in Sanskrit, Samantabhadra), the primordial Buddha, source of all lineages. Kuntuzangpo is shown iconographically as a naked [Buddha](#buddha), the deep blue color of the sky. However this symbol does not represent a person, but the [Buddha-nature](#buddha-nature) itself, the unchanging purity of the mind which is the fundamental nature of all beings. Normally this nature is hidden, and it is the teacher who has realized it themselves who can lead us to discover it within ourselves, in all its glorious nakedness. [Lama](#lama) literally means, "there is nothing higher." This is the Tibetan expression for the Indian word Guru. Both these words have become overused in common speech, but, as Patrul Rinpoche explains, for us, the spiritual teacher is like the Buddha himself. He brings us the transmission of the Buddhas of the past, embodies for us the Buddhas of the present, and, through his teaching, is the source of the Buddhas of the future. Patrul Rinpoche says that the [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga) is in a sense superior to the generation and perfection phases, because it directly opens the way to ultimate wisdom through the teacher's blessings.

## The origins of this translation

The Tibetans have preserved all aspects of Indian Buddhism intact from the eighth century to the twentieth. This has not been, however, a mere static preservation of sacred treasures. The Buddha Dharma was the main preoccupation of Tibet's best minds for centuries, giving rise to an extraordinary range of philosophical, poetic, academic and inspirational literature, as well as a distinctive and magnificent artistic and architectural heritage. But above all, the Tibetans used the Buddhist teachings for their true purpose, as a tool for transforming the human mind, and thousands of practitioners, some of them famous teachers, others unknown yogis, accomplished their final goal.

One might imagine that Tibet's greatest glories belong to the remote past, and that recent centuries represent a period of decline, but this is by no means the case. In fact each century (including the present one) and each generation has produced its share of spiritual giants. The nineteenth century, for example, saw a particular kind of renaissance. Patrul Rinpoche was a participant in the *rime* or non-sectarian movement, inaugurated by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgon Kongtrul and others, which sought to break down the barriers that had crystallized between the different Buddhist schools, by studying and teaching them all impartially. This spirit is still alive today, exemplified by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and the late Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who was the incarnation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo.

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, like Patrul, came from Eastern Tibet. He spent twenty years of his life in meditation retreats, often in the simplest conditions. He studied with a vast number of teachers, even meeting some of Patrul Rinpoche's own disciples in his youth. He responded to the terrible destruction in Tibet in the nineteen fifties and sixties by working tirelessly to find, preserve and reprint lost texts, to establish monastic communities in exile, and above all to teach and inspire the new generations. He considered Patrul Rinpoche to be the perfect example of a Dzogchen practitioner, and encouraged and helped the translators of this book, which he considered tob e the perfect guide for students embarking on the Buddhist path.

Our translation comes directly from within the tradition. In a sense it has its own lineage. Dudjom Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Kangyur Rinpoche, Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche, and the other [lamas](#lama) who taught us the entire text orally&mdash;and during the translation gave us their advice on the difficult points of the book&mdash;are realized holders of Patrul Rinpoche's teaching.

Although close adherence to the exact words of an original text commands a certain respect in Tibetan circles, we have found that such translations often make ideas which are perfectly lucid and reasonable in Tibetan seem unnecessarily obscure and even bizarre in English. For this book in particular, such a method could never reflect the extraordinary lively vernacular style and humor of the original. So although we have tried to be consistent in our translation of technical terms, we have aimed to reflect not only the words, but also the atmosphere and style, by rendering the ideas in a natural English, keeping as close to the Tibetan as possible, but not at the expense of the clarity and flow of the whole.

Brief explanations that we felt might be helpful to many readers appear as footnotes. There are also a large number of endnotes, not all of which will be of interest to the general reader. However we felt it important to include them, since they contain fascinating comments from the notes of Patrul Rinpoche's disciples, and interpretations of the more difficult points given by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and other teachers. They will help the reader to avoid some common misunderstandings about Buddhist ideas; and for the Buddhist practitioner with some previous knowledge of the subject, these comments give a revealing extra dimension to the book.

*<h1 id="historical-introduction" align="center">A brief historical introduction to Tibetan Buddhism</h1>*

Gautama the Buddha was born in Northern India in the fifth century BC, the son of a king who brought him up as heir to the throne. His birth and youth were remarkable, and it was clear from the beginning that the young prince Siddhartha was destined to be an extraordinary being. His early life was spent in palatial luxury, with few worries or cares, and he excelled in all the pursuits of his time, both academic and athletic.

Before long, however, he began to doubt the validity of his worldly life. Fleeing his father's palace, he sought a more meaningful life, studying under a number of highly regarded masters of philosophy and meditation. Such was the sincerity of his quest that he rapidly achieved the highest meditational accomplishments that these masters could teach him, but he was still not satisfied. Despite years of strenuous ascetic practice, he found that none of these systems could take him beyond the limits of conditioned existence. He decided to continue his search alone, and through his own efforts finally attained enlightenment at present-day Bodh Gaya. What he discovered was so profound and vast that at first he was reluctant to reveal it to anyone else, fearing that none would understand it. Later however he began teaching, and quickly attracted a large following of disciples, many of whom became highly accomplished in meditation.

The diversity of people who came to teh Buddha to receive his teaching and practice his path called for a corresponding diversity in the way in which he taught, and different individuals or groups received different instructions appropriate to their respective temperaments and intellectual abilities. The teachings that the Buddha taught during his lifetime can therefore be broadly divided into three categories&mdash;those that were eventually collected together in the Pali Canon and form the basis for what is now known as the Theravada School, emphasizing moral discipline and ethics; the teachings of the [Mahayana](#mahayana), or Great Vehicle, which stress compassion and concern for others; and the tantric teachings of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) or [Secret Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana), which use an enormous variety of skillful methods to bring about profound realization in a relatively short time. The latter were given by the Buddha himself only on a limited scale, but he predicted that they would be spread in this world by other enlightened beings, who would appear later. This is why the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is no less a Buddhist teaching than the other two schools, even though it was not widely taught in the Buddha's lifetime.

After his death the differences between the various teachings that he had given became more rigidly apparent as different schools and traditions took shape. The present Theravada tradition, for example, has its beginnings in a group of the Buddha's disciples which later divided into eighteen schools. The [Mahayana](#mahayana) similarly diversified into a number of traditions, each with their own subtly individual philosophical differences. The same is true for the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana), in which there is an immense variety of practices, many of which were originally taught only to a single individual.

During the centuries that followed, these different traditions were gradually propagated all over India and further afield, until Buddhism had extended its influence through much of Central, Eastern and Southern Asia, even as far as Indonesia. Some traditions were lost entirely, others merged into newer forms of Buddhism. By the thirteenth century AD, the arrival of Islam and political changes in Indian society had driven the Buddha-dharma from its land of origin, and it was in other countries that the teachings were preserved&mdash;the Theravada in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand and Cambodia, the [Mahayana](#mahayana) in China, Japan, Korea and Indochina, and the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) mainly in Tibet. Tibet was doubly fortunate. Not only was it one of the few countries in which the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) continued to be practiced, it was also the only one in which the full range of teachings, from all three traditions, was transmitted and preserved.

Over the centuries these many strands of the Buddha's teaching have been handed down from master to student in the numerous lineages which comprise the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism we know today. The members of these lineages were not simply learned scholars who studied the teachings they received, but fully realized individuals who had practiced and mastered what had been transmitted to them, and were thus fully qualified to pass on the teachings to their students.

One of these four, the [Nyingma school](#nyingmapa) (whose name derives from the Tibetan for "old") follows the traditions which were originally introduced in the eighth century by such Indian masters as [Santaraksita](#santaraksita), [Vimalamitra](#vimalamitra), and [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), whom the Tibetans refer to as [Guru Rinpoche](#guru-rinpoche), "the Precious Master," and handed down through fully realized Tibetan masters such as [Longchenpa](#longchenpa), [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa), and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. The lineages which have been passed down to the other three main schools&mdash; the [Kagyupa](#kagyupa), [Sakyapa](#sakyapa), and [Gelugpa](#gelugpa)&mdash;were introduced into Tibet after the tenth century following the attempts by an anti-Buddhist king to destroy the Dharma in Tibet. Just as the different forms of Buddhism in other parts of Asia had been adopted and had evolved to meet the needs of different peoples and cultures, each of these four schools had its origins and development in widely diverging situations&mdash;historical, geographical and even political&mdash;which served as a prism to split the light of the Buddha's teaching into a many-coloured spectrum of traditions and lineages. (Sadly, some Buddhists have tended to forget that this light has one source, and, as in the world's other great religions, sectarian divisions have sometimes masked the true message of Buddhism.)

The teachings preserved in the lineages of Tibetan Buddhism are contained in the enormous sacred literature of that tradition. The Kangyur, consisting of more than a hundred volumes, contains the scriptures originating from the time of the Buddha, and is divided into the [Vinaya](#vinaya), dealing with ethics and discipline, the [Sutras](#sutra), which are concerned with meditation and the [Abhidharma](#abhidarma), which covers Buddhist philosophy. The numerous commentaries on these, and other major Buddhist works written later make up over two hundred volumes of the Tangyur. Both the Kangyur and Tangyur were translated into Tibetan mainly from Sanskrit and comprise the Tibetan Buddhist Canon. In addition to this, a vast number of other works exist: teachings introduced into Tibet from India from the eighth century onwards (including many of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) teachings), and countless commentaries on all three vehicles ([Sravakayana](#sravakayana), [Mahayana](#mahayana), and [Vajrayana](#vajrayana)) written by Tibetan masters.

The enormous range of teachings to be found within Tibetan Buddhism can nevertheless be summarized by the Four Noble Truths, which the Buddha expounded shortly after his enlightenment. The first of these points out that our conditioned existence is never free from a state of suffering, never truly satisfactory. Any happiness we have is only temporary and in due course gives way to suffering. The reason for this, as explained by the second truth, is that any action one may do, say or think gives rise to a result which has to be experienced either later in one's life or in a future life. Indeed, rebirth is the result of one's actions, and the conditions into which one is born in one life are directly dependent on the actions one has done in previous lives, and particularly the motives and attitudes involved.  This, the [principle of cause and effect](#principle-of-cause-and-effect), explains why, for example, some people remain poor all their lives despite their efforts to become wealthy, while others have everything they could want even though they do nothing to gain it. The second truth goes on to show that the **driving force behind our actions is the negative emotions such as hatred, attachment, pride, jealousy, and especially ignorance, which is the root of all the others.** This ignorance concerns not only a lack of wisdom in how we act, but the basic ignorance behind how we ordinarily perceive the whole of existence and constantly become caught by our clinging to the idea of our own egos and of the outer world as solid and lasting. Because there is no end to our actions, there can be no end to our continuously taking rebirth in the cycle of conditioned existence. Only when we cease to act through ignorance can this cycle be broken, as shown by the third truth which expounds the cessation of suffering and freedom from conditioned existence.

The fourth truth explains the way through which this can be achieved. This essentially means, on the one hand, the accumulation of positive actions, such as venerating and making offerings to the [Buddha](#buddha), [Dharma](#dharma) (his teaching), and [Sangha](#sangha) (the community of practitioners), and practicing charity and so on; and on the other hand, the practice of meditation, which can directly dispel the root ignorance which is the cause of suffering. A practitioner who follows this path with only his own liberation in mind can attain a high degree of realization and become and [Arhat](#arhat) (one who has overcome the negative emotions). But this is not full enlightenment. Only those who have as their motivation the good and ultimate enlightenment of all other beings can attain final Buddhahood. Such practitioners, who follow the path of the [Great Vehicle](#great-vehicle) based on compassion, are known as [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva). A [Bodhisattva](#bodhisattva) who moreover practices the profound and skilful teachings of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is able to become fully enlightened in a very short time.

During his lifetime the Buddha created a community of monks and nuns who became the core for upholding and continuing the teachings. This did not, however, exclude lay men and women as serious followers of the path, and this was reflected in Tibet where, from the 8th century onwards, the community of practitioners comprised two complementary congregations: on the one hand, a very large monastic community, and on the other a strong tradition of practitioners with lay ordination, whether [yogis](#yogi-or-yogini) or householders, many of whom would appear to be leading ordinary lives while following an inner spiritual path and eventually attaining full realization.<sup>*</sup> Within the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) tradition monastic ordination is considered a very useful support for the practice, but by no means the only way to progress in meditation. This is encouraging for those who seriously wish to put the teachings into practice but are unable to involve themselves in a monastic lifestyle.

<sup>*The 'community of red-robed celibates' (*rab byung ngur smrigs sde*) and 'community of white-clad with long plaited hair' (*gos dkar lcang lo can kyi sde*).</sup>

Albert Einstein once pointed out that Buddhism was the tradition that he felt fulfilled the criteria he thought necessary for a spiritual path adapted to the twentieth century. Today modern physicists are drawing conclusions which approach the doctrines the Buddha expounded two thousand five hundred years ago. While the attractions of materialism have had an adverse affect on traditional spiritual life throughout Asia, there are increasing numbers of people in the West who are showing an interest in the possibilities offered by the study and practice of Buddhism.

When the continuity of the Buddhist lineages was threatened by the political changes in Tibet in the nineteen fifties, numerous qualified [lamas](#lama), who had not only received the proper lineage transmissions from their teachers, but also, through study and meditation, gained full understanding and realization of the teachings, sought to preserve them by bringing them to India. At the same time, some Western visitors to India began to show an interest in these [lamas](#lama) and their spiritual heritage. Since it had been said by [Guru Rinpoche](#guru-rinpoche) that, of the Buddha's teachings, the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) would prove especially powerful and effective for individuals living in a time when emotions are stronger than ever, many teachers felt that it would be appropriate to introduce these teachings to the West. The [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is particularly flexible and adaptable to the sorts of situations in which modern people find themselves, and, without losing its traditional form, has now been taught to a wide range of people all over the world.

# <div align="center">CHAPTER ONE<br><i>The difficulty of finding the freedoms and advantages</i></div>

The main subject of the chapter, the teaching on how difficult it is to find the freedoms and advantages, is preceded by an explanation of the proper way to listen to any spiritual instruction.

## I. THE PROPER WAY TO LISTEN TO SPIRITUAL TEACHING

The proper way to listen to the teachings has two aspects: the right attitude and the right conduct.

### **1. Attitude**

The right attitude combines the vast attitude of the *bodhicitta*, the mind of enlightenment, and the vast [skill in means](#skilful-means) of the [Secret Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana).

#### 1.1 THE VAST ATTITUDE OF THE BODHICITTA
There is not a single being in [samsara](#samsara), this immense ocean of suffering, who in the course of time without beginning has never been our father or mother. When they were our parents, these beings' only thought was to raise us with the greatest possible kindness, protecting us with great love and giving us the very best of their own food and clothing.

All of these beings, who have been so kind to us, want to be happy, and yet they have no idea how to put into practice what brings about happiness, the **ten positive actions**. None of them want to suffer, but they do not know how to give up the **ten negative actions** at the root of all suffering. Their deepest wishes and what they actually do thus contradict each other. Poor beings, lost and confused, like a blind man abandoned in the middle of an empty plain!

Tell yourself: "It is for their well-being that I am going to listen to the profound [Dharma](#dharma) and put it into practice. I will lead all these beings, my parents, tormented by the miseries of the [six realms of existence](#six-realms-of-existence), to the state of omniscient Buddhahood, freeing them from all the [karmic phenomena](#karmic-energy), habitual patterns and sufferings of every one of the [six realms](#six-realms-of-existence)." It is important to have this attitude each time you listen to teachings or practice them.

Whenever you do something positive, whether of major or minor importance, it is indispensable to enhance it with the three supreme methods. Before beginning, arouse the bodhicitta as a skilful means to make sure that the action becomes a source of good for the future. While carrying out the action, avoid getting involved in any conceptualization,<sup>[1](#1)</sup> so that the merit cannot be destroyed by circumstances.<sup>[2](#2)</sup> At the end, seal the action properly by dedicating the [merit](#merit), which will ensure that it continually grows ever greater.<sup>[3](#3)</sup>

<details id="1"><summary>Note <sup>1</sup></summary>For beginners, this means avoiding a materialistic or ambitions attitude to the practice. In fact only realized practitioners can practice with true freedom from concepts, but as one's practice matures, freedom from grasping comes progressively.</details>

<details id="2"><summary>Note <sup>2</sup></summary>The positive energy of the practice can also be channelled away from enlightenment into other things. NT mentions four circumstances which destroy one's sources of merit. (<i>dge rtsa</i>):<br>  
1. Not dedicating the action to the attainment of perfect Buddhahood for the sake of other.<br>
2. Anger: one moment of anger is said to be capable of destroying <a href="#kalpa">kalpas</a> of positive actions.<br>
3. Regret: regretting the beneficial actions one has done, even partially.<br>
4. Boasting of one's positive actions to others.</details>

<details id="3"><summary>Note <sup>3</sup></summary>NT explains that just as when a drop of water becomes part of the ocean it will continue to exist as long as the ocean exists, when the merit of one's actions is completely dedicated to "the fruit, the ocean of Omniscience," it will not be lost until one has attained complete Buddhahood.</details>

The way you listen to the [Dharma](#dharma) is very important. But even more important is the motivation with which you listen to it.

> What makes an action good or bad?  
Not how it looks, nor whether it is big or small,  
But the good or evil motivation behind it.

No matter how many teachings you have heard, to be motivated by ordinary concerns&mdash;such as a desire for greatness, fame or whatever&mdash;is not the way of the true [Dharma](#dharma). So, **first of all, it is most important to turn inwards and change your motivation**. If you can correct your attitude, [skilful means](#skilful-means) will permeate your positive actions, and you will have set out on the path of great beings. If you cannot, you might think that you are studying and practicing the [Dharma](#dharma) but it will be no more than a semblance of the real thing. Therefore, whenever you listen to the teachings and whenever you practice, be it meditating on a [deity](#deity), doing [prostrations](#prostration) and [circumambulations](#circumambulation), or reciting a [mantra](#mantra)&mdash;even a single *[mani](#mani)*&mdash;**it is always essential to give rise to bodhicitta**.

#### 1.2 VAST SKILL IN MEANS: THE ATTITUDE OF THE SECRET MANTRAYANA

The *Torch of the Three Methods* says of the [Secret Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana):

>It has the same goal but is free from all confusion,<sup>[4](#4)</sup>  
It is rich in methods and without difficulties.<sup>[5](#5)</sup>  
It is for those with sharp faculties.<sup>[6](#6)</sup>  
The Mantra Vehicle is sublime.

<details id="4"><summary>Note <sup>4</sup></summary>
"The object of view (<i>lta yul</i>) of both the <a href="#sutra">sutras</a> and the tantras is the same, i.e. <a href="#absolute-space">absolute space</a> (<i>chos kyi dbyings</i>, Skt. <i>dharmadhatu</i>). But with regard to the view itself, a distinction may be made, as when one speaks of seeing a form 'clearly' or of seeing it 'indistinctly.' The Vehicle of Characteristics (the sutras) establishes the support, the essence, the <a href="#absolute-truth">absolute truth</a>, great <a href="#emptiness">emptiness</a> beyond the eight conceptual extremes (<i>spros mtha'</i>), but it is not able to realize that its nature is the inseparable union of space and primordial wisdom (<i>dbyings ye zung 'jug</i>). As for what is supported, the phenomena of relative reality, the Vehicle of Characteristics establishes them as being interdependent and like a magical illusion. But it does not go further than this impure magical display, to establish the <a href="#kaya">kayas</a> and wisdoms. The Vehicle of the Secret Mantras, on the other hand, establishes the higher great <a href="#dharmakaya">dharmakaya</a>, the array of <a href="#kaya">kayas</a> and wisdoms which have always been inseparable, the two absolute truths." NT
</details>
<details id="5"><summary>Note <sup>5</sup></summary>
"In the Vehicle of Characteristics it is not taught that one can attain Enlightenment without abandoning the five objects of desire (<i>'dod pai yon tan lnga</i>). But here (in the Resultant Vehicle) one deals with the mind quickly and easily, taking it on the paths in which one does not abandon these five objects, and one can attain the level of Union, the level of Vajradhara, in one life and one body."</details>
<details id="6"><summary>Note <sup>6</sup></summary>
Beings with sharp faculties are those who are "intelligent enough to be able to realize the profound view of the Adamantine Vehicle of Secret Mantras and who possess sufficient confidence not to be afraid of vast and powerful actions."</details>  

The [Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana) can be entered by many routes. It contains many methods for accumulating [merit](#merit) and [wisdom](#wisdom), and profound [skillful means](#skilful-means) to make the potential within us manifest<sup>[7](#7)</sup> without our having to undergo great hardships. The basis for these methods is the way we direct our aspirations:

> Everything is circumstantial  
And depends entirely on one's aspiration.  

<details id="7"><summary>Note <sup>7</sup></summary>
According to the <a href="#secret-mantrayana">Secret Mantrayana</a> one does not create or develop anything by following the path. One is simply making visible something which is already present&mdash;one's own Buddha-nature.
</details>

Do not consider the place where the [Dharma](#dharma) is being taught, the teacher, the teachings and so on as ordinary and impure. As you listen, keep the [five perfections](#five-perfections) clearly in mind:

The perfect *place* is the citadel of the absolute expanse, called [Akanistha](#akanistha), "the Unexcelled." The perfect *teacher* is [Samantabhadra](#samantabhadra), the [dharmakaya](#dharmakaya). The perfect *assembly* consists of the male and female [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva) and [deities](#deity)<sup>[8](#8)</sup> of the [mind lineage of the Conquerors](#mind-lineage-of-the-conquerors) and of the [symbol lineage of the Vidyadharas](#symbol-lineage-of-the-vidyadharas).

<details id="8"><summary>Note <sup>8</sup></summary>
One should not see them as ordinary (<i>rags pa</i>) but as subtle (<i>phra ba</i>) or extremely subtle (<i>shin tu phra ba</i>) beings." DKR "All in the assembly, whether they realize it or not, are pervaded by the <a href="#buddha-nature">Buddha nature</a> just as sesame seeds are pervaded by oil... So all sentient beings are <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a>, visualized as <a href="#daka">dakas</a> and <a href="#dakini">dakinis</a> of the appropriate family. If both teacher and retinue are Buddhas, their <a href="#buddhafield">Buddhafield</a> is also pure and should be visualized as <a href="#akanistha">Akanistha</a> or another <a href="#pure-land">pure land</a>." NT
</details>

Or you can think that the place where the [Dharma](#dharma) is being taught is the Lotus-Light Palace of the [Glorious Copper-colored Mountain](#glorious-copper-colored-mountain), the teacher who teaches is [Padmasambhava of Oddiyana](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), and we, the audience, are the Eight [Vidyadharas](#vidyadhara), the [Twenty-five Disciples](#twenty-five-disciples), and the [dakas](#daka) and [dakinis](#dakini).

Or consider that this perfect place is the Eastern [Buddhafield](#buddhafield), [Manifest Joy](#manifest-joy), where the perfect teacher [Vajrasattva](#vajrasattva), the perfect [sambhogakaya](#sambhogakaya), is teaching the assembly of the divinities of the Vajra Family and male and female [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva).

Equally well, the perfect place where the [Dharma](#dharma) is being taught can be the Western Buddhafield, the Blissful, the perfect teacher the Buddha [Amitabha](#amitabha), and the assembly the male and female [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva) and [deities](#deity) of the Lotus family.

Whatever the case, the *teaching* is that of the [Great Vehicle](#great-vehicle) and the *time* is the ever-revolving wheel of eternity.

These visualizations<sup>[9](#9)</sup> are to help us understand how things are in reality. It is not that we are temporarily creating something that does not really exist.

<details id="9"><summary>Note <sup>9</sup></summary>
<i>gsal btab pa</i> means visualize but also to bring to mind, to have clearly in one's mind, to refresh one's memory. "Visualizing in this way does not mean telling oneself that a donkey is a horse or that a piece of coal is gold; it means having vividly in one's mind what has always been so from the beginning, that appearances and beings spring from the primal ground, which is the state of Buddhahood." NT
</details>

The teacher embodies the essence of all [Buddhas](#buddha) throughout the [three times](#three-times). He is the union of the [Three Jewels](#three-jewels): his body is the [Sangha](#sangha), his speech the [Dharma](#dharma), his mind the [Buddha](#buddha). He is the union of the [Three Roots](#three-roots): his body is the teacher, his speech the [yidam](#yidam), his mind the [dakini](#dakini). He is the union of the [three kayas](#three-kayas): his body is the [nirmanakaya](#nirmanakaya), his speech the [sambhogakaya](#sambhogakaya), his mind the [dharmakaya](#dharmakaya). He is the embodiment of all the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the past, source of all the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the future and the representative of all the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the present. Since he takes as his disciples degenerate beings like us, whom none of the thousand Buddhas of the [Good Kalpa](#good-kalpa)<sup>[10](#10)</sup> could help, his compassion and bounty exceed that of all [Buddhas](#buddha).

<details id="10"><summary>Note <sup>10</sup></summary>
"In this <a href="#kalpa">kalpa</a> a thousand <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a> are to appear. However, we have not met those <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a> who have already come&mdash;or if we did meet them they did not succeed in bringing us to liberation. As for the <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a> of the future, it is still too soon for us to meet them. So without our spiritual teachers we would hav no one to help us." DKR
</details>

>The teacher is the [Buddha](#buddha), the teacher is the [Dharma](#dharma),  
The teacher is also the [Sangha](#sangha).  
The teacher is the one who accomplishes everything.  
The teacher is Glorious [Vajradhara](#vajradhara).

We, as the assembly gathered to listen to the teachings, use the basis of our own [Buddha-nature](#buddha-nature), the support of our precious human life, the circumstance of having a [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) and the method of following his advice, to become the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the future. As the *Hevajra Tantra* says:

> All beings are [Buddhas](#buddha),  
But this is concealed by adventitious stains.  
When their stains are purified, their Buddhahood is revealed.

### **2. Conduct**

The right conduct while listening to teachings is described in terms of what to avoid and what to do.

#### 2.1 WHAT TO AVOID

Conduct to avoid includes the three defects of the pot, the six stains and the five wrong ways of remembering.

##### 2.1.1 The Three Defects of the Pot

Not to listen is to be like a pot turned upside down. Not to be able to retain what you hear is to be like a pot with a hole in it. To mix negative emotions with what you hear is to be like a pot with poison in it.

*The upside-down pot*. When you are listening to the teachings, listen to what is being said and do not let yourself be distracted by anything else. Otherwise you will be like an upside-down pot on which liquid is being poured. Although you are physically present, you do not hear a word of the teaching.

*The pot with a hole in it*. If you just listen without remembering anything that you hear or understand, you will be like a pot with a leak: however much liquid is poured into it, nothing can stay. No matter how many teachings you hear, you can never assimilate them or put them into practice.

*The pot containing poison*. If you listen to the teachings with the wrong attitude, such as the desire to become great or famous, or a mind full of the [five poisons](#five-poisons), the [Dharma](#dharma) will not only fail to help your mind; it will also be changed into something that is not [Dharma](#dharma) at all, like [nectar](#nectar) poured into a pot containing poison.

This is why the Indian sage, [Padampa Sangye](#padampa-sangye), said:
> Listen to the teachings like a deer listening to music;  
Contemplate them like a northern nomad shearing sheep;<sup>*</sup>  
Meditate on them like a dumb person savouring food;<sup>**</sup>  
Practice them like a hungry yak eating grass;  
Reach their result, like the sun coming out from behind the clouds.  
>
> <sup> *That is to say, meticulously, in their entirety, and without distraction.</sup>  
> <sup> **A dumb person can taste, but not describe the flavors they are tasting. In the same way, the taste of true meditation is beyond any description or concepts.</sup>

When listening to the teachings, you should be like a deer so entranced by the sound of the *[vina](#vina)* that it does not notice the hidden hunter shooting his poisoned arrow. Put your hands together palm to palm and listen, every pore on your body tingling and your eyes wet with tears, never letting any other thought get in the way.

It is no good listening with only your body physically present, while your mind wanders off after your thoughts and your speech lets loose a rich store of gossip, saying whatever you like and looking around everywhere. When listening to teachings, you should even stop reciting prayers, counting mantras, or whatever other meritorious activities you may be doing.

After you have listened properly to a teaching in this way, it is then also important to retain the meaning of what has been said without ever forgetting it, and to continually put it into practice. For, as the Great Sage himself said:

> I have shown you the methods  
That lead to liberation.  
But you should know  
That liberation depends upon yourself.

The teacher gives the disciple instructions explaining how to listen to the [Dharma](#dharma) and how to apply it, how to give up [negative actions](#negative-action), how to perform [positive ones](#positive-action), and how to practice. It is up to the disciple to remember those instructions, forgetting nothing; to put them into practice; and to realize them.

Just listening to the [Dharma](#dharma) is perhaps of some benefit by itself. But unless you remember what you hear, you will not have the slightest knowledge of either the words or the meaning of the teaching&mdash;which is no different from not having heard it at all.

If you remember the teachings but mix them with your [negative emotions](#negative-emotions), they will never be the pure [Dharma](#dharma). As the peerless [Dago Rinpoche](#dago-rinpoche) says:

> Unless you practice [Dharma](#dharma) according to the [Dharma](#dharma),  
[Dharma](#dharma) itself becomes the cause of evil rebirths.

Rid yourself of every wrong thought concerning the teacher and the [Dharma](#dharma), do not criticize or abuse your [spiritual brothers companions](#spiritual-companions), be free of pride and contempt, abandon all bad thoughts. For all of these cause lower rebirths.

##### 2.1.2 The Six Stains

In the *Well Explained Reasoning*, it says:

> Pride, lack of faith and lack of effort,  
Outward distraction, inward tension and discouragement;  
These are the six stains.

Avoid these six: proudly believing yourself superior to the teacher who is explaining the [Dharma](#dharma), not trusting the master and their teachings, failing to apply yourself to the [Dharma](#dharma), getting distracted by external events, focussing your five senses too intently inwards, and being discouraged if, for example, a teaching is too long.

Of all negative emotions, pride and jealousy are the most difficult to recognize. Therefore, examine your mind minutely. Any feeling that there is something even the least bit special about your own qualities, whether worldly or spiritual, will make you blind to your own faults and unaware of others' good qualities. So renounce pride and always take a low position.

If you have no faith, the entrance to the [Dharma](#dharma) is blocked. Of the four types of faith,<sup>[11](#11)</sup> aim for faith that is irreversible.

<details id="11"><summary>Note <sup>11</sup></summary>
The first three are explained in Part Two, Chapter One. A fourth, irreversible faith, is sometimes added to denote the culmination of faith, when it has become an integral part of one's being.
</details>

Your interest<sup>[12](#12)</sup> in the [Dharma](#dharma) is the basis of what you will achieve. So depending on whether your degree of interest is superior, middling or inferior you will become a superior, middling or inferior practitioner. And if you are not at all interested in the [Dharma](#dharma), there will be no results at all. As the proverb puts it:

<details id="12"><summary>Note <sup>12</sup></summary>
NT says "Whether or not we have received the Dharma, if we have no interest in it we will be like a horse who is offered a bone, or a dog presented with grass" <i>don gnyer</i>, "interest," also means "effort," that is to say, not only intellectual interest but also active engagement.
</details>

> The [Dharma](#dharma) is nobody's property. It belongs to whoever has the most endeavour.

The Buddha himself obtained the teachings at the price of hundreds of hardships. To obtain a single four-line verse, he gouged holes in his own flesh to serve as offering lamps, filling them with oil and planting in them thousands of burning wicks. He leapt into flaming pits, and drove a thousand iron nails into his body.<sup>[13](#13)</sup>

<details id="13"><summary>Note <sup>13</sup></summary>
These examples from stories of the Buddha's previous lives serve to illustrate the degree of his commitment and should not be taken as recommending extreme asceticism. 
</details>

> Even if you have to face blazing infernos or razor-sharp blades,  
Search for the [Dharma](#dharma) until you die.

Listen to the teachings, therefore, with great effort, ignoring heat, cold and all other trials.

The tendency of consciousness to get engrossed in the objects of the six senses<sup>[14](#14)</sup> is the root of all [samsara's](#samsara) hallucinations and the source of all suffering. This is how the moth dies in the lamp-flame, because its visual consciousness is attracted to forms; how the stag is killed by the hunter, because its hearing draws it to sounds; how bees are swallowed by carnivorous plants, seduced by their smell; how fish are caught with bait, their sense of taste lured by its flavor; how elephants drown in the swamp because they love the physical feeling of mud. In the same way, whenever you are listening to the [Dharma](#dharma), teaching, meditating or practicing, it is important not to follow tendencies from the past, not to entertain emotions about the future and not to let your present thoughts get distracted by anything around you . As [Gyalse Rinpoche](#gyalse-rinpoche) says:

<details id="14"><summary>Note <sup>14</sup></summary>
The sixth sense is mind, since the same psychological reactions are produced by objects which simply arise in thought as by objects perceived by the five physical sense.
</details>

> Your past joys and sorrows are like drawings on water:  
No trace of them remains. Don't run after them!  
But should they come to mind, reflect on how success and failure come and go.  
Is there anything you can trust besides [Dharma](#dharma), mani-reciters?<sup>[15](#15)</sup>
>
><details id="15"><summary>Note <sup>15</sup></summary>This refers to ordinary Tibetans, who characteristically have faith in the Dharma and recite the well known mantra, <i>Om mani padme hum</i>, but who may not have any detailed knowledge of the Buddhist teachings. Here Gyalse Rinpoche is using the term in a slightly derogatory way to provoke his listeners.</details>
>
> Your future projects and plans are like nets cast in a dry riverbed:   
They'll never bring what you want. Limit your desires and aspirations!  
But should they come to mind, think how uncertain it is when you'll die:  
Have you got time for anything other than [Dharma](#dharma), mani-reciters?
>
> Your present work is like a job in a dream.  
Since all such effort is pointless, cast it aside.  
Consider even your honest earnings without any attachment.  
Activities are without essence, mani-reciters!
> 
> Between meditation sessions, learn to control in this way all thoughts arising from the [three poisons](#three-poisons);  
Until all thoughts and perceptions arise as the [dharmakaya](#dharmakaya),  
This is indispensable&mdash;remembering it whenever you need it,  
Do not give rein to deluded thoughts, mani-reciters!

It also said:

> Don't invite the future. If you do,  
You're like the father of Famous Moon!

This refers to the story of a poor man who came across a large pile of barley. He put it in a big sack, tied it to a rafter, and then lay down beneath it and started to day-dream.

"This barley is going to make me really rich," he thought. "Once I'm rich, I'll get myself a wife... She's bound to have a boy... What shall I call him?"

Just then, the moon appeared and he decided to call his son Famous Moon. However, all this time a rat had been gnawing away at the rope that was holding up the sack. The rope suddenly snapped, the sack fell on the man and he was killed. 

Such dreams about the past and future will never come to fruition and are only a distraction. Give them up altogether. Be mindful and listen with attention and care.

Do not focus too intently, picking out individual words and points, like a *dremo* bear digging up marmots&mdash;each time you seize one item, you forget the one before, and will never get to understand the whole. **Too much concentration also makes you sleepy. Instead keep a balance between tight and loose.**

Once, in the past, [Ananda](#ananda) was teaching [Srona](#srona-sronajat) to meditate. Srona had great difficulty getting it right. Sometimes he was too tense, sometimes too relaxed. Srona went to discuss the matter with the Buddha, who asked him: "When you were a layman, you were a good *[vina](#vina)*-player, weren't you?"

"Yes, I played very well."

"Did your *vina* sound best when the strings were very slack or when they were very taut?"

"It sounded best when they were neither too taut nor too loose."

"It is the same for your mind," said the Buddha; and by practicing with that advice [Srona](#srona-sronajat) attained his goal.

[Machik Labdron](#machik-labdron) says:

> Be firmly concentrated and loosely relaxed:<sup>[16](#16)</sup>  
Here is an essential point for the View.

<details id="16"><summary>Note <sup>16</sup></summary>
<i>grims kyis sgrim la lhod kyis glod</i>. "This means without distraction, but very relaxed at the same time." DKR. Furthermore, at first it is necessary to rein in the wild thoughts to achieve sustained calm (<i>zhi gnas</i>), then one has to relax the mind to allow the expansion of profound insight (<i>lhag mthong</i>).
</details>

Do not let your mind get too tense or too inwardly concentrated; let your senses be naturally at ease, balanced between tension and relaxation.

You should not tire of listening to the teachings. Do not feel discouraged when you get hungry or thirsty during a teaching that goes on too long, or when you have to put up with discomfort caused by the wind, sun, rain and so forth. Just be glad that you now have the freedoms and advantages of human life, that you have met an authentic teacher, and that you can listen to their profound instructions.

The fact that you are at this moment listening to the profound [Dharma](#dharma) is the fruit of [merits](#merit) accumulated over innumerable [kalpas](#kalpa). It is like eating a meal when you have only eaten once every hundred mealtimes throughout your life. So it is imperative to listen with joy, vowing to bear heat, cold and whatever trials and difficulties might arise, in order to receive these teachings.

##### 2.1.3 The Five Wrong Ways of Remembering

> Avoid remembering the words but forgetting the meaning,  
Or remembering the meaning but forgetting the words.  
Avoid remembering both but with no understanding,  
Remembering them out of order, or remembering them incorrectly.

Do not attach undue importance to elegant turns of phrase without making any attempt to analyze the profound meaning of the words, like a child gathering flowers. Words alone are of no benefit for the mind. On the other hand, do not disregard the way in which the teachings are expressed, as being just the words and therefore dispensable. For then, even if you grasp the profound meaning, you will no longer have the means through which to express it. Words and meaning will have lost their connection.<sup>[17](#17)</sup>

<details id="17"><summary>Note <sup>17</sup></summary>
"That the way the teachings are expressed are just the words and therefore dispensable is what people say who think they are great [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) meditators. They think that they can grasp the essential naked meaning without bothering about the words. Pointing to their hearts they will say that this explanation is just words which have no substance and that it is only necessary to understand the essence of mind."
</details>

If you remember the teaching without identifying the different levels&mdash;the expedient meaning, the real meaning and the indirect meaning&mdash;you will be confused about what the words refer to.<sup>[18](#18)</sup> This may lead you away from the true [Dharma](#dharma). If you remember it out of order, you will mix up the proper sequence of the teaching, and every time you listen to it, explain it, or meditate on it the confusion will be multiplied.  If you remember incorrectly what has been said, endless wrong ideas will proliferate.<sup>[19](#19)</sup> This will spoil your mind and debase the teaching. Avoid all these errors and remember everything&mdash;the words, the meaning and the order of the teachings&mdash;properly and without any mistake.

<details id="18"><summary>Note <sup>18</sup></summary>
The real meaning expresses the truth from the point of view of realized beings. The expedient meaning refers to teachings intended to lead unrealized beings towards that truth, who would not be able to accept or understand it if it was stated directly. The indirect meaning refers to teachings given to beings to introduce them indirectly to a meaning which is not directly stated.
</details>

<details id="19"><summary>Note <sup>19</sup></summary>
"That is misunderstanding the meaning, imagining, for instance, that from the moment when one has received the teaching of the <a href="#secret-mantrayana">Secret Mantrayana</a> one can enjoy sex and alcohol, and perform the practices of union and liberation. To avoid this mistake, one's conduct should be appropriate to the moment (i.e. to the level of spiritual evolution that we have actually reached at the present moment)."
</details>

However long and difficult the teaching may be, do not feel disheartened and wonder if it will ever end; persevere. And however short and simple it may be, do not undervalue it as just elementary.

To remember both words and meaning perfectly, in the right order and with everything properly linked together, is therefore indispensable.

#### 2.2 WHAT TO DO

The conduct to be adopted while listening to teachings is explained as the four metaphors. the six transcendent perfections, and other modes of conduct.

##### 2.2.1 The Four Metaphors

*The Sutra Arranged like a Tree says:*

> Noble one, you should think of yourself as someone who is sick,  
Of the [Dharma](#dharma) as the remedy,  
Of your [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) as a skilful doctor,  
And of diligent practice as the way to recovery.

We are sick. From beginningless time, in this immense ocean of suffering that is [samsara](#samsara), we have been tormented by the illness of the [three poisons](#three-poisons) and their fruit, the three kinds of suffering.

When people are seriously ill, they go to consult a good doctor. They follow the doctor's advice, take whatever medicine they prescribe, and do all they can to overcome the disease and get well. In the same way, you should cure yourself of the diseases of [karma](#karma), [negative emotions](#negative-emotions) and suffering by following the prescriptions of that experienced doctor, the authentic teacher, and by taking the medicine of the [Dharma](#dharma).

Following a teacher without doing what they say is like disobeying your doctor, which leaves them no chance of treating your illness. Not taking the medicine of the [Dharma](#dharma)&mdash;that is to say, not putting it into practice&mdash;is like having innumerable medications and prescriptions beside your bed but never touching them. That will never cure your disease.

These days, people say full of optimism, "Lama, look on me with compassion!" thinking that even if they have done many terrible things, they will never have to endure the consequences. They reckon that the teacher, in their compassion, will toss them up into the heavenly realms as if they were throwing a pebble. But when we speak of the teacher holding us with their compassion, what this really means is that they have lovingly accepted us as disciples, and that they give us their profound instructions, opens our eyes to what to do and what not to do and shows us the way to liberation taught by the [Conqueror](#conqueror). What greater compassion could there be? It is up to us whether or not we take advantage of this compassion and actually pursue the path of liberation.

Now that we have this free and well-endowed human birth, now that we know what we should and should not do, our decision at this juncture, when we have the freedom to choose, marks the turning-point which will determine our fate, for better or worse, far into the future.<sup>[20](#20)</sup> It is crucial that we choose between [samsara](#samsara) and [nirvana](#nirvana) once and for all and put the instructions of our teacher into practice.

<details id="20"><summary>Note <sup>20</sup></summary>
AT "an inspiration which is good or bad forever." Here we have followed the explanation of DKR.
</details>

Those who conduct village ceremonies will have you believe that on your death-bed you can still go up or down, as if you were steering a horse by the reins. But by that time, unless you have already mastered the path, the fierce [wind](#wind) of your past actions will be chasing after you, while in front a terrifying black darkness rushes toward you as you are driven helplessly down the long and perilous path of the [intermediate state](#intermediate-state). The Lord of Death's countless henchmen will be pursuing you, crying, "Kill! Kill! Strike! Strike!" How could such a moment&mdash;when there is no place to run to and nowhere to hide, no refuge and no hope, when you are desperate and have no idea what to do&mdash;how could such a moment be the turning point at which you control whether you go up or down? As the Great One of Oddiyana says:

> By the time empowerment is being given to the card marked with your name,<sup>[21](#21)</sup> it's too late! Your consciousness, already wandering in the intermediate state like a dazed dog, will find it very hard to even think of higher realms.
>
><details id="21"><summary>Note <sup>21</sup></summary>This refers to a purification practice for the dead in which the dead person is represented by a card bearing their name.</details>

In fact the turning point, the only time that you really can direct yourself up or down as if steering a horse with the reins, is right now, while you are still alive.

As a human being, your positive actions are more powerful than those of other kinds of being. This gives you, on the one hand, an opportunity here and now in this very life to cast rebirth aside once and for all.<sup>[22](#22)</sup> But your negative actions are more powerful too; thus you are also quite capable of making sure, on the other hand, that you will never get free from the depths of the lower realms. So now that you have met the teacher, the skilful doctor, and the [Dharma](#dharma), the elixir that conquers death, this is the moment to apply the four metaphors, putting the teachings you have heard into practice, and traveling the path of liberation.

<details id="22"><summary>Note <sup>22</sup></summary>
The expression <i>thod pa bor chog ma</i> literally means "getting rid of the skull," that is, of getting rid of one's body, in the sense of freeing oneself from future rebirths. DKR
</details>

The *Treasury of Precious Qualities* describes four wrong notions that must be avoided, which are the opposite of the four metaphors we have mentioned:

> Shallow-tongued men with evil natures  
Approach the teacher as if he were a musk-deer.  
Having extracted the musk, the perfect [Dharma](#dharma),  
Full of joy, they sneer at the [samaya](#samaya).

Such people behave as though their spiritual teacher were a musk-deer, the [Dharma](#dharma) were the musk, they themselves the hunters, and intense practice the way to kill the deer with an arrow or a trap. They do not practice the teachings they have received and feel no gratitude toward the teacher. They use [Dharma](#dharma) to accumulate evil actions, which will drag them down like a millstone to the lower realms.

##### 2.2.2 The Six Transcendent Perfections

In the *Tantra of Thorough Comprehension of the Instructions on all Dharma Practices*, it says:

> Make excellent offerings such as flowers and cushions ***(generosity)***,  
Put the place in order and control your behavior ***(discipline)***,  
Do not harm any living being ***(patience)***,  
Have genuine faith in your teacher ***(diligence)***,  
Listen to his instructions without distraction ***(concentration)***  
And question him in order to dispel your doubts; ***(wisdom)***  
These are the six transcendent perfections of a listener.

A person listening to the teaching should practice the six transcendent perfections as follows:

Prepare the teacher's seat, arrange cushions upon it, offer a mandala, flowers and other offerings, This is the practice of ***generosity***.

Sweep clean the place or room after carefully settling the dust with water, and refrain from all disrespectful conduct. This is the practice of ***discipline***.

Avoid harm to living beings, even the smallest of insects, and bear heat, cold and all other difficulties. This is the practice of ***patience***.

Lay aside any wrong views concerning the teacher and the teaching and listen joyfully with genuine faith. This is the practice of ***diligence***.

Listen to the [Lama's](#lama) instructions without distraction. This is the practice of ***concentration***.

Ask questions to clear up any hesitations and doubts. This is the practice of ***wisdom***.

##### 2.2.3 Other Mods of Conduct

All forms of disrespectful behavior should be avoided. The *Vinaya* says:

> Do not teach those who have no respect,  
Who cover their heads although in good health,  
Who carry canes, weapons and parasols,  
Or whose heads are swathed in turbans.

and the *Jatakas*:

> Take the lowest seat.  
Cultivate the dignified bearing of thorough discipline.  
With your eyes brimming with joy,  
Drink in the words like nectar  
And be completely concentrated.  
That is the way to listen to the teaching.
