<p align="center">Also known as [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), the Lotus-born, he is the "Second Buddha" who established Buddhism in Tibet. He is shown here in the form known as "Prevailing Over Appearances and Existence" (Nangsi Zilnon), the name meaning that, as he understands the nature of everything that appears, he is naturally the master of all situations.</p>

# INTERNATIONAL SACRED LITERATURE TRUST

The International Sacred Literature Trust was established to promote understanding and open discussion between and within faiths and to give voice in today's world to the wisdom that speaks across time and traditions.

What resources do the sacred traditions of the world possess to respond to the great global threats of poverty, war, ecological disaster and spiritual despair?

Our starting-point is the sacred texts with their vision of a higher truth and their deep insights into the nature of humanity and the universe we inhabit. The translation programme is planned so that each faith community articulates its own teachings with the intention of enhancing its self-understanding as well as the understanding of those of other faiths and those of no faith.

The Trust particularly encourages faiths to make available texts which are needed in translation for their own communities and also texts which are little known outside the tradition but which have the power to inspire, console, enlighten and transform. These sources from the past become resources for the present and future when we make inspired use of them to guide us in shaping the contemporary world.

Our religious traditions are diverse but, as with the natural environment, we are discovering the global interdependence of human hearts and minds. The Trust invites all to participate in the modern experience of interfaith encounter and exchange which marks a new phase in the human quest to discover our full humanity.

Jig-me Gyal-wai Nyu-gu, who was one of the eminent disciples of Jig-me Ling-pa, the exponent of Dzog-pa Chen-po Long-chen Nying-thig, gave an oral instruction on Long-chen Nying-thig and his disciple Dza Pal-trul Rinpoche transcribed it, giving it the title: KUNSANG LA-MAI ZHAL-LUNG.

It is said in the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection) teachings that one cannot become enlightened through a contrived mind; rather, the basic mind is to be identified, in relation to which all phenomena are to be understood as the sport of the mind. One then familiarizes oneself continuously and one-pointedly with this ascertainment. However, to have a full understanding of this it is not not sufficient merely to read books; one needs the full preparatory practice of the Nying-ma system and, in addition, the special teaching of a qualified Nying-ma master as well as his blessings. The student must also have accumulated great merit. That is why great [Nying-ma-pa](#nyingmapa) masters like Jig-me Ling-pa and Do-drup-chen worked so hard.

Translation of such works containing the Dzog-chen preliminaries will be of immense value these days. I congratulate the Padmakara Translation Group for having produced this work in English and French. I am sure this authentic preliminary work will benefit all those who are interested in Dzog-chen.

*<h1 id="forewordhhdkr" align="center">Foreword<br>by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche</h1>*

*The Words of My Perfect Teacher, a Guide to the Preliminaries for the Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse from the Great Perfection*, sets out the paths of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism without any conflict between them.

It contains all the teachings, including the Steps of the Path for those of the three levels of understanding, along with the Three Main Themes of the Path; the Three Perceptions, preliminaries for the Path and Fruit; the [Buddha Nature](#buddha-nature) as the cause, precious human life as the support, the [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) as the impetus, his instructions as the method, and the [kayas](#kaya) and wisdoms as the result, these representing the confluence of the [Kadampa](#kadampa) and [Mahamudra](#mahamudra) traditions; and the [Nyingma](#nyingmapa) path in terms of determination to be free through disgust for [samsara](#samsara), faith through confidence in the effect of actions, bodhicitta through striving to help others, and pure perception of the utter purity of everything there is.

For all teachings on all practices, whether preliminaries or main, this text is indispensable. That is why, at this fortunate time in which the [Buddha's](#buddha) precious doctrine is beginning to shine its light throughout the world, this book has been translated in the profound hope that&mdash;being of enormous worth and little danger, and covering as it does all the essential points of the path&mdash;all contact with it may be fruitful, and that it may become the object of study, reflection and meditation. That followers of [Dharma](#dharma) teach or listen to this text is of great importance.

*<h1 id="acknowledgements" align="center">Translators' Acknowledgements</h1>*

In accordance with Tibetan tradition, the translators would like to thank the teachers of the lineage: the late Dudjom Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and Kangyur Rinpoche, whose extraordinary inspiration and patient explanations form the basis for all our efforts to understand these teachings; and also the numerous other [lamas](#lama) who answered our questions and gave us encouragement&mdash;Dodrup Chen Rinpoche, Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche, Dzogchen Khenpo Thubten, Zenkar Rinpoche, Khetsun Zangpo Rinpoche, Lama Sonam Tobgyal and many others.

The Padmakara Translation Group is made up of students of Tibetan Buddhism from several countries and disciplines, working under the direction of Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche, at the centre d'Etudes de Chanteloube in Dordogne, Southwest France.

The history of this particular project runs parallel to the evolution of the group, many of whose members began their study of Patrul Rinpoche's *Kunzang Lamai Shelung* in the mid seventies, both in India and in Europe. They were then taught in detail from it, as the basis for their own practice of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) path during the traditional meditation retreats which started in 1980 at Chanteloube. The text was translated into French by members of the group guided by their Tibetan teachers, and published as *Le Chemin de La Grande Perfection* by the newly-formed Editions Padmakara in 1987.

The first stage of the English version was a draft translation from the French by Michael Dickman. This was the starting point for a new translation from the original Tibetan. It was prepared, with many revisions, by Christian Bruyat, Charles Hastings and John Canti. Stephen Gethin provided editorial help and prepared the index.

The translators are grateful to readers Michal Abrams, Wulstan Fletcher, Helena Blankleder, Rinchen Lhamo, Elissa Mannheimer and Vivian Kurz for their valuable suggestions, and to Jill Heald for help with the typescript.

Finally, our warmest thanks to Kerry Brown of the International Sacred Literature Trust for her constant and patient encouragement.

*<h1 id="digital-preface" align="center">Preface to the Hand-copied Digital Edition from the Second Edition</h1>*

Thank you great teachers. In response to the need for an enhanced mobile friendly and durable version of this text, <a href="https://github.com/ryanallen">Ryan Allen</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanallen/words-of-my-perfect-teacher/activity?sort=ASC">hand-typed</a> this digital edition from the printed second edition for research and study. May it help end all sufferings.

Enhancements include a linked and clickable table of contents, linked sections, linked glossary terms and collapsible notes. New notes to clarify things (like explaining what the four continents are in [ Note 37.1](#37-1)) with links to their sources. Sections identified by numbers (example: *[The Three Defects of the Pot](#211-the-three-defects-of-the-pot)*) now feature corresponding numbers and, where applicable, section titles for clarity. British spellings have been changed to american spellings (Ex: armour --> armor). Footnotes are at the bottom of paragraphs in the absence of page numbers. In the interest of inclusivity, gendered pronouns have been replaced with gender-neutral equivalents where appropriate. Added missing chapters to Part Three's introduction section. Changed numbered list of the five kinds of transference into headings.

May all beings be free from suffering.

*<h1 id="preface" align="center">Preface to the Second Edition</h1>*

  The encouraging need for this book to be reprinted has made possible a number of changes. A preface written by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche for the French edition has been included, as well as a postface written by Jamgon Kongtrul the Great for the very first woodblock printing of this book in Tibetan a century ago. The quality of the [illustrations](#listofillustrations) has been improved, the [notes](#notes) and [glossary](#glossary) have been expanded and revised, and Sanskrit words have been given their standard transliterated spelling.

  However, the principal change is a revision of the text itself, the fruit of a painstaking, detailed re-reading by Pema Wangyal Rinpoche. His numerous comments, clarifications and queries&mdash;on average three or four per page&mdash;have enabled us to take a critical look at the accuracy of our translation and to bring it closer still to Patrul Rinpoche's original meaning. Readers of the first edition may be assured that we have found no glaring errors in the substance of the instructions and practices explained. Nevertheless, in a text so justly celebrated for its extraordinary wealth of detail and anecdote, it is in those finer details that we hope the translation has gained in authenticity and accuracy.

No translation will ever be definitive. Our hope is that we may continue to improve the translation of this text in the future, particularly since&mdash;as testified by the many encouraging letters we have received from all over the world&mdash; it is used intensively by many individual readers and Buddhist groups as a tool for study and practice. Had time allowed, we would have liked to undertake a thorough revision of the endnotes in the light of a new translation of one of the principal sources from which they were compiled, Khenpo Ngawang Palzang's *Notes*, currently proceeding under the direction of Alak Zenkar (with the participation of several members of the Padmakara Translation Group, see bibliography). That, unfortunately, will have to await a third edition.

All the changes to this edition were compiled, edited and entered by John Canti, with valuable help from Maria Jesus Hervas, whose assiduous work in preparing a forthcoming Spanish translation uncovered a number of errors and omissions in the English, and from readers Helena Blankleder, Charles Hastings, Steven Gethin and Wulstan Fletcher.

Once again, we are grateful for the continuing interest and support of the Sacred Literature Trust and its successive directors, Paul Seto and Malcolm Gerratt&mdash;and especially for their patience, which the delays in the preparation of this second edition must have sorely tested.

*<h1 id="introduction" align="center">Translators' Introduction</h1>*

*The Words of My Perfect Teacher* is one of the best-loved introductions to the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism, constantly recommended by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other eminent teachers. It provides a detailed guide to the methods by which an ordinary person can transform his or her consciousness and set off on the path to Buddhahood, the state of awakening and freedom. The first half of the book contains a series of contemplations on the frustration and deep suffering of [samsara](#samsara), the round of existence based on ignorance and deluded emotions, and the enormous value of our human life, which provides a unique opportunity to attain Buddhahood. The second half explains the first steps of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana), the "Diamond Vehicle" whose powerful methods of transformation provide the distinctive character of the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism.

Patrul Rinpoche's work is not a treatise for experts but a manual of practical advice for anyone sincerely wishing to practice the [Dharma](#dharma). He wrote it in a style that could speak as easily to rough nomads and villagers as to lamas and monks. In fact he claimed that it was not really a literary composition at all, but that he had simply set down the oral instructions of his own teacher as he himself had heard them. The particular magic of the book is that we feel that we are Patrul Rinpoche's own students, listening to his heartfelt advice, based on the oral tradition that he received from his own teacher and the deep experience of years of practice.

He explains everything we need to know to practice the teachings&mdash;and also, often with devastating irony, the many mistakes that can be made on the spiritual journey. The language veers from high poetry to broad vernacular. Each point is illustrated by numerous quotations, down-to-earth examples from daily life, and a wealth of stories. Some of these stories go back to the very origins of Buddhism in the 6th century BC and beyond; some are drawn from the extraordinary lives of the great masters of India and Tibet; some concern the doings of the ordinary folk of Patrul Rinpoche's native Kham.

Patrul Rinpoche was famous for the direct way he probed the depths of this students' minds. He was a firm believer in [Atisa's](#atisa) dictum, **"The best [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) is the one who attacks your hidden faults."** Although his work is clearly adapted to his particular audience, with a little effort of transposition we can see that human nature remains remarkably the same regardless of time and culture. We feel that the recesses of our own character are exposed and we are forced to question our own habits of thought and open our minds to new possibilities.

In his concluding chapter the author describes his work as follows:

> In writing down these instructions I have not been guided primarily by aesthetic or literary considerations. My main aim has simply been to record faithfully the oral instructions of my revered teacher in a way that is easy to understand and useful for the mind. I have done my best not to spoil them by mixing in my own words or ideas. On separate occasions my teacher also used to give numerous special instructions for exposing hidden faults, and I have added whatever I have been able to remember of these in the most appropriate places. Do not take them as a window through which to observe others' faults, but rather as a mirror for examining your own. Look carefully within yourself to see whether or not you have those hidden faults. If you do, recognize them and take them out of their hiding place. Correct your mind and set it at ease on the right path...

For [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) Buddhism, enlightenment is not a remote ideal but something which, with the appropriate methods and a supreme effort, can be achieved here and now, in this very life. In Tibet's living wisdom tradition, every scripture, every meditation practice and training for the mind, is passed on from teacher to student, and then internalized till it becomes an integral part of that person's experience. One of the words for spiritual practice in Tibetan is *nyamlen*, literally "taking into experience." Someone who can be considered a lineage holder, a truly qualified spiritual teacher, must have actually attained realization. Patrul Rinpoche held a continuous line of transmission coming down from the Buddha himself. This lineage has been passed on unbroken, from one realized teacher to the next, until the present day.

*<p id="Nyugu-il" align="center">Jigme Gyalwai Nyugu</p>*
Patrul Rinpoche's perfect teacher. Patrul Rinpoche heard his explanation of the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* many times, and claimed that *The Words of My Perfect Teacher* was nothing more or less than a faithful compendium of what he had heard on those different occasions.

## Patrul Rinpoche and the tradition he inherited

In the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) school, to which Patrul Rinpoche belonged, and which is the oldest tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, there are two kinds of transmission. There is the Kahma, (*bka' ma*) or oral lineage, passed on from teacher to student over the centuries, and there is the miraculous direct lineage of Terma (*gter ma*) or [Spiritual Treasures](#spiritual-treasure). These were hidden in the eighth century by [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana) and his great woman disciple [Yeshe Tshogyal](#yeshe-tsogyal), to be discovered in later ages at the appropriate moment. *The Words of My Perfect Teacher* is an explanation of the preliminary practices of the *Longchen Nyingtik* (*klong chen snying thig*), *The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse*, a [spiritual treasure](#spiritual-treasure) discovered by [Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) (1729 - 1798).

[alt text](image_url)

*<p id="jigme-gyalwai-nyugu-il" align="center">Jigme Gyalwai Nyugu</p>*
[Patrul Rinpoche's](#patrul-rinpoche-and-the-tradition-he-inherited) perfect teacher. Patrul Rinpoche heard his explanation of the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* many times, and claimed that *The Words of My Perfect Teacher* was nothing more or less than a faithful compendium of what he had heard on those different occasions.

[Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) was a prodigy who became immensely learned with almost no study, through arousing his wisdom mind in a series of long meditation retreats. He received the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* in a series of visions of [Longchenpa](#longchenpa), a great [lama](#lama) of the fourteenth century.

[Longchenpa](#longchenpa) systematized the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) doctrines in his astonishing *Seven Treasures* (*mdzod bdun*, see [bibliography](#bibliography)) and other works, which cover all aspects of the Buddhist teachings, and in particular discuss fully the subtleties of [Dzogchen, the Great Perfection](#great-perfection). He also wrote extensively on the teachings of the other schools, but these works have been lost. Although [Longchenpa](#longchenpa) lived several centuries before him, he was in fact [Jigme Lingpa's](#jigme-lingpa) principal teacher.

[Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) first practiced and mastered the teachings he had discovered, and then passed them on to a few close disciples who were capable of becoming pure holders of the doctrine. One of these was Patrul Rinpoche's teacher, Jigme Gyalwai Nyugu, who after spending a considerable time with [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) in central Tibet, returned to Kham (the eastern region of the country). There he undertook the practice of what [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) had taught him, living on a remote mountainside in a mere depression in the ground, without even a cave for shelter, and with only wild plants for food. He was indifferent to comfort and convenience, determined to let go of all worldly considerations and concentrate on the goal of ultimate realization. Gradually disciples gathered around him, living in tents on the windswept hillside. One of these was the young Patrul, who received from him, no less than fourteen times, the teachings contained in this book. Subsequently Patrul also studied with many other great [lamas](#lama) of the day, including the highly unconventional Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje, who directly introduced him to the nature of the mind.

Throughout his life Patrul Rinpoche emulated the uncompromising simplicity of his master. Although he had been recognized in his childhood as an incarnate [lama](#lama) or [*tulku*](#tulku)&mdash;his name is an abbreviation of Palgye Tulku&mdash;and would normally have had a high position in a monastic establishment, he spent his life wandering from place to place, camping in the open, in the guise of an ordinary beggar. If he was offered gold or silver he would often just leave it lying on the ground, thinking that wealth was only a source of trouble. Even when he had become a famous teacher, he would travel around unrecognized, living in the same simple and carefree manner. There is even a story of a [lama](#lama) he met on his travels who, thinking he was a good fellow who might benefit from such an extraordinary teaching, taught him this very text. On another occasion he traveled with a poor widow, helping her to cook and to take care of her children, carrying them on his back. When they arrived at their destination, Patrul Rinpoche excused himself, saying he had something important to do. The woman heard that the great Patrul Rinpoche was teaching at the monastery. She went there to watch, and was amazed to see her traveling companion on the throne instructing a vast assembly. At the end of the teaching he asked that all the offerings be given to her.

To his students he was immensely kind, but also immensely tough. He treated beggars and kins in exactly the same way. In all situations his only interest was to benefit others, and he would always say whatever would be most useful, regardless of social niceties.

## The stages of practice

*The Words of My Perfect Teacher* belongs to a category of literature known as "written guides" (*khrid yig*), which emulate and supplement the oral explanations needed to elucidate a meditation text. In this case the text in question is the preliminary practice of the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse*.

The *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse* cycle of teachings that [Longchenpa](#longchenpa) passed on to [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa) has become one of the most widely practiced in the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) school. It contains a complete [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) path, starting at the beginner stage with the preliminary practices (*sngon 'gro*). Then comes the main practice (*dngos gzhi*), which has three principal parts, the generation phase (*bskyed rim*) the perfection phase (*rdzogs rim*), and the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection) (*rdzogs pa chen po*).

The preliminary practices have an outer and an inner section, and our text is accordingly divided into two. The  first part, the ordinary or external preliminaries, deals with:  
1. the freedoms and advantages offered by human life
2. impermanence
3. the sufferings of [samsara](#samsara)
4. how [karma](#karma), the principle of cause and effect, applies to all our actions
5. the benefits of liberation and
6. how to follow a spiritual teacher.

These elements are fundamental for a proper understanding of Buddhist values. They are general because they are the fundamentals of Buddhism in general. The contemplations in this section can be practiced by anyone, Buddhist or not.

The second part, the inner preliminaries, starts with taking refuge&mdash;learning to rely on the Buddha, the [Dharma](#dharma) (his teaching) and the [Sangha](#sangha) (the Buddhist community). This is the basis of Buddhist commitment common to all traditions. Next comes the development of bodhicitta, the "mind of enlightenment." This attitude of unconditional love and compassion, that seeks to bring all beings to perfect freedom, is the basis of the [Mahayana](#mahayana). It is followed by practices to purify the effects of one's past negative actions and accumulate the positive energy necessary to progress on the path. These practices use more fully the techniques of visualization and mantra specific to the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) approach.

Finally comes the [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga), uniting one's mind with the mind of the teacher. [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga) is the very root of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana), where the purity of the link between teacher and disciple is of paramount importance. Also included here is the practice of *phowa*, or transference of consciousness, a shortcut method to enable those who are unable to pursue the path to the end to be liberated nonetheless at the time of death.

For the practices in Part Two, it is necessary to have the guidance of a qualified teacher. Indeed this is advisable for any spiritual practice. In pre-communist Tibet almost all Tibetans considered themselves Buddhists, and they would try to follow Buddhist ethics, make offerings and recite some prayers and [mantras](#mantra). This remains largely true even in occupied Tibet today. A smaller number of those who are Buddhists in this general sense then take the decision to pursue the spiritual journey actively, and it is such people who would undertake these practices, usually repeating each element one hundred thousand times.

Next comes the practices of the generation and perfection phases, culminating in the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection). In the Tibetan tradition the inner journey is mapped with astonishing precision. For each stage of the practice there are oral explanations and explanatory texts. [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is a science of the mind, in which an expert teacher fully understands the significance of each experience, and the solution for each error. Our present text does not go into the details of the rest of the path, but we shall give a brief overview here, to give an idea of the progression that follows on from the preliminaries.

### The preliminary practice

*The outer preliminaries* comprise the four contemplations which turn away from [samsara](#samsara).
*The inner preliminaries* are:
1. taking refuge
2. bodhicitta
3. purification through the practice of [Vajrasattva](#vajrasattva)
4. accumulation of merit through the offering of the [mandala](#mandala), and
4. [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga).

Sometimes there are additional elements, as in the *Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse*. The ritual text may be quite long or very short. This, however, is the general structure.

### The generation phase

In the generation phase one learns to develop and enlightened vision of the world by visualizing oneself as a [Buddha](#buddha), and one's surroundings as a pure [Buddhafield](#buddhafield), while reciting the appropriate [mantra](#mantra). This process is at first artificial, something which is developed or generated, but the visualizations correspond to the visionary experience of enlightened beings. By adopting these new habits of perception, one can weaken the ordinary habits of gross perception based on ignorance and emotional tendencies, and put oneself in touch with a more subtle level of experience. These practices take the form of *sadhanas*, the ritual texts for which are sometimes extraordinarily poetic.

### The perfection phase

Once the sacred vision has become a living experience, the perfection phase completes the process, taking it to a more interior level by working with the subtle energies of the body, through mastery of the breath, physical postures and other [yogas](#yoga).

### The Great Perfection

In the generation and perfection phases one acquires the illustrative wisdom (*dpe'i ye shes*) through meditation experiences which serve as pointers to indicate the ultimate nature of the mind. In Dzogchen&mdash;the [Great Perfection](#great-perfection)&mdash;the nature of the mind is introduced directly and suddenly by the teacher. This is an immediate experiential recognition of the [Buddha-nature](#buddha-nature) itself. The subsequent practice consists essentially in getting used to that experience and developing it in an increasingly vast way. Here one acquires real or absolute wisdom (*don gyi ye shes*), the direct experience of ultimate truth.

---

In a sense, each level of practice builds on the previous one, but at the same time it further strips away the layers of delusion, leaving an ever more denuded experience of reality. Each practice is also a complete path in itself, in which&mdash;for those who have the wisdom to see it&mdash;all the others are included. Even the preliminaries, and indeed the individual elements of the preliminaries, can, in themselves, constitute a complete path to enlightenment.

In particular, the [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga) is the essence of all paths. The teachers of the lineage often say that all practices should be done in the manner of [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga). Total openness and devotion to a realized teacher is the most sure and rapid way to progress.

Patrul Rinpoche expresses this capital importance of the spiritual teacher in the very title of this book, Kunzang Lamai Shelung, which we have freely translated as *The Words of My Perfect Teacher*.

Kunzang means "everywhere perfect" or "always perfect." It is the abbreviated form of Kuntuzangpo (in Sanskrit, Samantabhadra), the primordial Buddha, source of all lineages. Kuntuzangpo is shown iconographically as a naked [Buddha](#buddha), the deep blue color of the sky. However this symbol does not represent a person, but the [Buddha-nature](#buddha-nature) itself, the unchanging purity of the mind which is the fundamental nature of all beings. Normally this nature is hidden, and it is the teacher who has realized it themselves who can lead us to discover it within ourselves, in all its glorious nakedness. [Lama](#lama) literally means, "there is nothing higher." This is the Tibetan expression for the Indian word Guru. Both these words have become overused in common speech, but, as Patrul Rinpoche explains, for us, the spiritual teacher is like the Buddha himself. He brings us the transmission of the Buddhas of the past, embodies for us the Buddhas of the present, and, through his teaching, is the source of the Buddhas of the future. Patrul Rinpoche says that the [Guru Yoga](#guru-yoga) is in a sense superior to the generation and perfection phases, because it directly opens the way to ultimate wisdom through the teacher's blessings.

## The origins of this translation

The Tibetans have preserved all aspects of Indian Buddhism intact from the eighth century to the twentieth. This has not been, however, a mere static preservation of sacred treasures. The Buddha Dharma was the main preoccupation of Tibet's best minds for centuries, giving rise to an extraordinary range of philosophical, poetic, academic and inspirational literature, as well as a distinctive and magnificent artistic and architectural heritage. But above all, the Tibetans used the Buddhist teachings for their true purpose, as a tool for transforming the human mind, and thousands of practitioners, some of them famous teachers, others unknown yogis, accomplished their final goal.

One might imagine that Tibet's greatest glories belong to the remote past, and that recent centuries represent a period of decline, but this is by no means the case. In fact each century (including the present one) and each generation has produced its share of spiritual giants. The nineteenth century, for example, saw a particular kind of renaissance. Patrul Rinpoche was a participant in the *rime* or non-sectarian movement, inaugurated by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgon Kongtrul and others, which sought to break down the barriers that had crystallized between the different Buddhist schools, by studying and teaching them all impartially. This spirit is still alive today, exemplified by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and the late Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who was the incarnation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo.

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, like Patrul, came from Eastern Tibet. He spent twenty years of his life in meditation retreats, often in the simplest conditions. He studied with a vast number of teachers, even meeting some of Patrul Rinpoche's own disciples in his youth. He responded to the terrible destruction in Tibet in the nineteen fifties and sixties by working tirelessly to find, preserve and reprint lost texts, to establish monastic communities in exile, and above all to teach and inspire the new generations. He considered Patrul Rinpoche to be the perfect example of a Dzogchen practitioner, and encouraged and helped the translators of this book, which he considered tob e the perfect guide for students embarking on the Buddhist path.

Our translation comes directly from within the tradition. In a sense it has its own lineage. Dudjom Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Kangyur Rinpoche, Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche, and the other [lamas](#lama) who taught us the entire text orally&mdash;and during the translation gave us their advice on the difficult points of the book&mdash;are realized holders of Patrul Rinpoche's teaching.

Although close adherence to the exact words of an original text commands a certain respect in Tibetan circles, we have found that such translations often make ideas which are perfectly lucid and reasonable in Tibetan seem unnecessarily obscure and even bizarre in English. For this book in particular, such a method could never reflect the extraordinary lively vernacular style and humor of the original. So although we have tried to be consistent in our translation of technical terms, we have aimed to reflect not only the words, but also the atmosphere and style, by rendering the ideas in a natural English, keeping as close to the Tibetan as possible, but not at the expense of the clarity and flow of the whole.

Brief explanations that we felt might be helpful to many readers appear as footnotes. There are also a large number of endnotes, not all of which will be of interest to the general reader. However we felt it important to include them, since they contain fascinating comments from the notes of Patrul Rinpoche's disciples, and interpretations of the more difficult points given by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and other teachers. They will help the reader to avoid some common misunderstandings about Buddhist ideas; and for the Buddhist practitioner with some previous knowledge of the subject, these comments give a revealing extra dimension to the book.

*<h1 id="historical-introduction" align="center">A brief historical introduction to Tibetan Buddhism</h1>*

Gautama the Buddha was born in Northern India in the fifth century BC, the son of a king who brought him up as heir to the throne. His birth and youth were remarkable, and it was clear from the beginning that the young prince Siddhartha was destined to be an extraordinary being. His early life was spent in palatial luxury, with few worries or cares, and he excelled in all the pursuits of his time, both academic and athletic.

Before long, however, he began to doubt the validity of his worldly life. Fleeing his father's palace, he sought a more meaningful life, studying under a number of highly regarded masters of philosophy and meditation. Such was the sincerity of his quest that he rapidly achieved the highest meditational accomplishments that these masters could teach him, but he was still not satisfied. Despite years of strenuous ascetic practice, he found that none of these systems could take him beyond the limits of conditioned existence. He decided to continue his search alone, and through his own efforts finally attained enlightenment at present-day Bodh Gaya. What he discovered was so profound and vast that at first he was reluctant to reveal it to anyone else, fearing that none would understand it. Later however he began teaching, and quickly attracted a large following of disciples, many of whom became highly accomplished in meditation.

The diversity of people who came to teh Buddha to receive his teaching and practice his path called for a corresponding diversity in the way in which he taught, and different individuals or groups received different instructions appropriate to their respective temperaments and intellectual abilities. The teachings that the Buddha taught during his lifetime can therefore be broadly divided into three categories&mdash;those that were eventually collected together in the Pali Canon and form the basis for what is now known as the Theravada School, emphasizing moral discipline and ethics; the teachings of the [Mahayana](#mahayana), or Great Vehicle, which stress compassion and concern for others; and the tantric teachings of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) or [Secret Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana), which use an enormous variety of skillful methods to bring about profound realization in a relatively short time. The latter were given by the Buddha himself only on a limited scale, but he predicted that they would be spread in this world by other enlightened beings, who would appear later. This is why the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is no less a Buddhist teaching than the other two schools, even though it was not widely taught in the Buddha's lifetime.

After his death the differences between the various teachings that he had given became more rigidly apparent as different schools and traditions took shape. The present Theravada tradition, for example, has its beginnings in a group of the Buddha's disciples which later divided into eighteen schools. The [Mahayana](#mahayana) similarly diversified into a number of traditions, each with their own subtly individual philosophical differences. The same is true for the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana), in which there is an immense variety of practices, many of which were originally taught only to a single individual.

During the centuries that followed, these different traditions were gradually propagated all over India and further afield, until Buddhism had extended its influence through much of Central, Eastern and Southern Asia, even as far as Indonesia. Some traditions were lost entirely, others merged into newer forms of Buddhism. By the thirteenth century AD, the arrival of Islam and political changes in Indian society had driven the Buddha-dharma from its land of origin, and it was in other countries that the teachings were preserved&mdash;the Theravada in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand and Cambodia, the [Mahayana](#mahayana) in China, Japan, Korea and Indochina, and the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) mainly in Tibet. Tibet was doubly fortunate. Not only was it one of the few countries in which the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) continued to be practiced, it was also the only one in which the full range of teachings, from all three traditions, was transmitted and preserved.

Over the centuries these many strands of the Buddha's teaching have been handed down from master to student in the numerous lineages which comprise the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism we know today. The members of these lineages were not simply learned scholars who studied the teachings they received, but fully realized individuals who had practiced and mastered what had been transmitted to them, and were thus fully qualified to pass on the teachings to their students.

One of these four, the [Nyingma school](#nyingmapa) (whose name derives from the Tibetan for "old") follows the traditions which were originally introduced in the eighth century by such Indian masters as [Santaraksita](#santaraksita), [Vimalamitra](#vimalamitra), and [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), whom the Tibetans refer to as [Guru Rinpoche](#guru-rinpoche), "the Precious Master," and handed down through fully realized Tibetan masters such as [Longchenpa](#longchenpa), [Jigme Lingpa](#jigme-lingpa), and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. The lineages which have been passed down to the other three main schools&mdash; the [Kagyupa](#kagyupa), [Sakyapa](#sakyapa), and [Gelugpa](#gelugpa)&mdash;were introduced into Tibet after the tenth century following the attempts by an anti-Buddhist king to destroy the Dharma in Tibet. Just as the different forms of Buddhism in other parts of Asia had been adopted and had evolved to meet the needs of different peoples and cultures, each of these four schools had its origins and development in widely diverging situations&mdash;historical, geographical and even political&mdash;which served as a prism to split the light of the Buddha's teaching into a many-coloured spectrum of traditions and lineages. (Sadly, some Buddhists have tended to forget that this light has one source, and, as in the world's other great religions, sectarian divisions have sometimes masked the true message of Buddhism.)

The teachings preserved in the lineages of Tibetan Buddhism are contained in the enormous sacred literature of that tradition. The Kangyur, consisting of more than a hundred volumes, contains the scriptures originating from the time of the Buddha, and is divided into the [Vinaya](#vinaya), dealing with ethics and discipline, the [Sutras](#sutra), which are concerned with meditation and the [Abhidharma](#abhidarma), which covers Buddhist philosophy. The numerous commentaries on these, and other major Buddhist works written later make up over two hundred volumes of the Tangyur. Both the Kangyur and Tangyur were translated into Tibetan mainly from Sanskrit and comprise the Tibetan Buddhist Canon. In addition to this, a vast number of other works exist: teachings introduced into Tibet from India from the eighth century onwards (including many of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) teachings), and countless commentaries on all [three vehicles](#three-vehicles) ([Sravakayana](#sravakayana), [Mahayana](#mahayana), and [Vajrayana](#vajrayana)) written by Tibetan masters.

The enormous range of teachings to be found within Tibetan Buddhism can nevertheless be summarized by the Four Noble Truths, which the Buddha expounded shortly after his enlightenment. The first of these points out that our conditioned existence is never free from a state of suffering, never truly satisfactory. Any happiness we have is only temporary and in due course gives way to suffering. The reason for this, as explained by the second truth, is that any action one may do, say or think gives rise to a result which has to be experienced either later in one's life or in a future life. Indeed, rebirth is the result of one's actions, and the conditions into which one is born in one life are directly dependent on the actions one has done in previous lives, and particularly the motives and attitudes involved.  This, the [principle of cause and effect](#principle-of-cause-and-effect), explains why, for example, some people remain poor all their lives despite their efforts to become wealthy, while others have everything they could want even though they do nothing to gain it. The second truth goes on to show that the **driving force behind our actions is the negative emotions such as hatred, attachment, pride, jealousy, and especially ignorance, which is the root of all the others.** This ignorance concerns not only a lack of wisdom in how we act, but the basic ignorance behind how we ordinarily perceive the whole of existence and constantly become caught by our clinging to the idea of our own egos and of the outer world as solid and lasting. Because there is no end to our actions, there can be no end to our continuously taking rebirth in the cycle of conditioned existence. Only when we cease to act through ignorance can this cycle be broken, as shown by the third truth which expounds the cessation of suffering and freedom from conditioned existence.

The fourth truth explains the way through which this can be achieved. This essentially means, on the one hand, the accumulation of positive actions, such as venerating and making offerings to the [Buddha](#buddha), [Dharma](#dharma) (his teaching), and [Sangha](#sangha) (the community of practitioners), and practicing charity and so on; and on the other hand, the practice of meditation, which can directly dispel the root ignorance which is the cause of suffering. A practitioner who follows this path with only his own liberation in mind can attain a high degree of realization and become and [Arhat](#arhat) (one who has overcome the negative emotions). But this is not full enlightenment. Only those who have as their motivation the good and ultimate enlightenment of all other beings can attain final Buddhahood. Such practitioners, who follow the path of the [Great Vehicle](#great-vehicle) based on compassion, are known as [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva). A [Bodhisattva](#bodhisattva) who moreover practices the profound and skilful teachings of the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is able to become fully enlightened in a very short time.

During his lifetime the Buddha created a community of monks and nuns who became the core for upholding and continuing the teachings. This did not, however, exclude lay men and women as serious followers of the path, and this was reflected in Tibet where, from the 8th century onwards, the community of practitioners comprised two complementary congregations: on the one hand, a very large monastic community, and on the other a strong tradition of practitioners with lay ordination, whether [yogis](#yogi-or-yogini) or householders, many of whom would appear to be leading ordinary lives while following an inner spiritual path and eventually attaining full realization.<sup>*</sup> Within the [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) tradition monastic ordination is considered a very useful support for the practice, but by no means the only way to progress in meditation. This is encouraging for those who seriously wish to put the teachings into practice but are unable to involve themselves in a monastic lifestyle.

<sup>*The 'community of red-robed celibates' (*rab byung ngur smrigs sde*) and 'community of white-clad with long plaited hair' (*gos dkar lcang lo can kyi sde*).</sup>

Albert Einstein once pointed out that Buddhism was the tradition that he felt fulfilled the criteria he thought necessary for a spiritual path adapted to the twentieth century. Today modern physicists are drawing conclusions which approach the doctrines the Buddha expounded two thousand five hundred years ago. While the attractions of materialism have had an adverse affect on traditional spiritual life throughout Asia, there are increasing numbers of people in the West who are showing an interest in the possibilities offered by the study and practice of Buddhism.

When the continuity of the Buddhist lineages was threatened by the political changes in Tibet in the nineteen fifties, numerous qualified [lamas](#lama), who had not only received the proper lineage transmissions from their teachers, but also, through study and meditation, gained full understanding and realization of the teachings, sought to preserve them by bringing them to India. At the same time, some Western visitors to India began to show an interest in these [lamas](#lama) and their spiritual heritage. Since it had been said by [Guru Rinpoche](#guru-rinpoche) that, of the Buddha's teachings, the [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) would prove especially powerful and effective for individuals living in a time when emotions are stronger than ever, many teachers felt that it would be appropriate to introduce these teachings to the West. The [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) is particularly flexible and adaptable to the sorts of situations in which modern people find themselves, and, without losing its traditional form, has now been taught to a wide range of people all over the world.

# <div align="center">CHAPTER ONE<br><i>The difficulty of finding the freedoms and advantages</i></div>

The main subject of the chapter, the teaching on [how difficult it is to find the freedoms and advantages](#ii-the-teaching-itself-an-explanation-of-how-difficult-it-is-to-find-the-freedoms-and-advantages), is preceded by an explanation of [the proper way to listen to any spiritual instruction](#i-the-proper-way-to-listen-to-spiritual-teaching).

## I. THE PROPER WAY TO LISTEN TO SPIRITUAL TEACHING

The proper way to listen to the teachings has two aspects: the right [attitude](#1-attitude) and the right [conduct](#2-conduct).

### **1. Attitude**

The right attitude combines [the vast attitude of the *bodhicitta*](#11-the-vast-attitude-of-the-bodhicitta), the mind of enlightenment, and [the vast skill in means of the Secret Mantrayana](#12-vast-skill-in-means-the-attitude-of-the-secret-mantrayana).

#### 1.1 THE VAST ATTITUDE OF THE BODHICITTA
There is not a single being in [samsara](#samsara), this immense ocean of suffering, who in the course of time without beginning has never been our father or mother. When they were our parents, these beings' only thought was to raise us with the greatest possible kindness, protecting us with great love and giving us the very best of their own food and clothing.

All of these beings, who have been so kind to us, want to be happy, and yet they have no idea how to put into practice what brings about happiness, the **ten positive actions**. None of them want to suffer, but they do not know how to give up the **ten negative actions** at the root of all suffering. Their deepest wishes and what they actually do thus contradict each other. Poor beings, lost and confused, like a blind man abandoned in the middle of an empty plain!

Tell yourself: "It is for their well-being that I am going to listen to the profound [Dharma](#dharma) and put it into practice. I will lead all these beings, my parents, tormented by the miseries of the [six realms of existence](#six-realms-of-existence), to the state of omniscient Buddhahood, freeing them from all the [karmic phenomena](#karmic-energy), habitual patterns and sufferings of every one of the [six realms](#six-realms-of-existence)." It is important to have this attitude each time you listen to teachings or practice them.

Whenever you do something positive, whether of major or minor importance, it is indispensable to enhance it with the three supreme methods. Before beginning, arouse the bodhicitta as a skilful means to make sure that the action becomes a source of good for the future. While carrying out the action, avoid getting involved in any conceptualization,<sup>[1](#1)</sup> so that the merit cannot be destroyed by circumstances.<sup>[2](#2)</sup> At the end, seal the action properly by dedicating the [merit](#merit), which will ensure that it continually grows ever greater.<sup>[3](#3)</sup>

<details id="1"><summary>Note <sup>1</sup></summary>For beginners, this means avoiding a materialistic or ambitions attitude to the practice. In fact only realized practitioners can practice with true freedom from concepts, but as one's practice matures, freedom from grasping comes progressively.</details>

<details id="2"><summary>Note <sup>2</sup></summary>The positive energy of the practice can also be channelled away from enlightenment into other things. NT mentions four circumstances which destroy one's sources of merit. (<i>dge rtsa</i>):<br>  
1. Not dedicating the action to the attainment of perfect Buddhahood for the sake of other.<br>
2. Anger: one moment of anger is said to be capable of destroying <a href="#kalpa">kalpas</a> of positive actions.<br>
3. Regret: regretting the beneficial actions one has done, even partially.<br>
4. Boasting of one's positive actions to others.</details>

<details id="3"><summary>Note <sup>3</sup></summary>NT explains that just as when a drop of water becomes part of the ocean it will continue to exist as long as the ocean exists, when the merit of one's actions is completely dedicated to "the fruit, the ocean of Omniscience," it will not be lost until one has attained complete Buddhahood.</details><br>

The way you listen to the [Dharma](#dharma) is very important. But even more important is the motivation with which you listen to it.

> What makes an action good or bad?  
Not how it looks, nor whether it is big or small,  
But the good or evil motivation behind it.

No matter how many teachings you have heard, to be motivated by ordinary concerns&mdash;such as a desire for greatness, fame or whatever&mdash;is not the way of the true [Dharma](#dharma). So, **first of all, it is most important to turn inwards and change your motivation**. If you can correct your attitude, [skilful means](#skilful-means) will permeate your positive actions, and you will have set out on the path of great beings. If you cannot, you might think that you are studying and practicing the [Dharma](#dharma) but it will be no more than a semblance of the real thing. Therefore, whenever you listen to the teachings and whenever you practice, be it meditating on a [deity](#deity), doing [prostrations](#prostration) and [circumambulations](#circumambulation), or reciting a [mantra](#mantra)&mdash;even a single *[mani](#mani)*&mdash;**it is always essential to give rise to bodhicitta**.

#### 1.2 VAST SKILL IN MEANS: THE ATTITUDE OF THE SECRET MANTRAYANA

The *Torch of the Three Methods* says of the [Secret Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana):

>It has the same goal but is free from all confusion,<sup>[4](#4)</sup>  
It is rich in methods and without difficulties.<sup>[5](#5)</sup>  
It is for those with sharp faculties.<sup>[6](#6)</sup>  
The Mantra Vehicle is sublime.

<details id="4"><summary>Note <sup>4</sup></summary>
"The object of view (<i>lta yul</i>) of both the <a href="#sutra">sutras</a> and the tantras is the same, i.e. <a href="#absolute-space">absolute space</a> (<i>chos kyi dbyings</i>, Skt. <i>dharmadhatu</i>). But with regard to the view itself, a distinction may be made, as when one speaks of seeing a form 'clearly' or of seeing it 'indistinctly.' The Vehicle of Characteristics (the sutras) establishes the support, the essence, the <a href="#absolute-truth">absolute truth</a>, great <a href="#emptiness">emptiness</a> beyond the eight conceptual extremes (<i>spros mtha'</i>), but it is not able to realize that its nature is the inseparable union of space and primordial wisdom (<i>dbyings ye zung 'jug</i>). As for what is supported, the phenomena of relative reality, the Vehicle of Characteristics establishes them as being interdependent and like a magical illusion. But it does not go further than this impure magical display, to establish the <a href="#kaya">kayas</a> and wisdoms. The Vehicle of the Secret Mantras, on the other hand, establishes the higher great <a href="#dharmakaya">dharmakaya</a>, the array of <a href="#kaya">kayas</a> and wisdoms which have always been inseparable, the two absolute truths." NT
</details>
<details id="5"><summary>Note <sup>5</sup></summary>
"In the Vehicle of Characteristics it is not taught that one can attain Enlightenment without abandoning the five objects of desire (<i>'dod pai yon tan lnga</i>). But here (in the Resultant Vehicle) one deals with the mind quickly and easily, taking it on the paths in which one does not abandon these five objects, and one can attain the level of Union, the level of Vajradhara, in one life and one body."</details>
<details id="6"><summary>Note <sup>6</sup></summary>
Beings with sharp faculties are those who are "intelligent enough to be able to realize the profound view of the Adamantine Vehicle of Secret Mantras and who possess sufficient confidence not to be afraid of vast and powerful actions."</details><br>  

The [Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana) can be entered by many routes. It contains many methods for accumulating [merit](#merit) and [wisdom](#wisdom), and profound [skillful means](#skilful-means) to make the potential within us manifest<sup>[7](#7)</sup> without our having to undergo great hardships. The basis for these methods is the way we direct our aspirations:

> Everything is circumstantial  
And depends entirely on one's aspiration.  

<details id="7"><summary>Note <sup>7</sup></summary>
According to the <a href="#secret-mantrayana">Secret Mantrayana</a> one does not create or develop anything by following the path. One is simply making visible something which is already present&mdash;one's own Buddha-nature.
</details><br>

Do not consider the place where the [Dharma](#dharma) is being taught, the teacher, the teachings and so on as ordinary and impure. As you listen, keep the [five perfections](#five-perfections) clearly in mind:

The perfect *place* is the citadel of the absolute expanse, called [Akanistha](#akanistha), "the Unexcelled." The perfect *teacher* is [Samantabhadra](#samantabhadra), the [dharmakaya](#dharmakaya). The perfect *assembly* consists of the male and female [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva) and [deities](#deity)<sup>[8](#8)</sup> of the [mind lineage of the Conquerors](#mind-lineage-of-the-conquerors) and of the [symbol lineage of the Vidyadharas](#symbol-lineage-of-the-vidyadharas).

<details id="8"><summary>Note <sup>8</sup></summary>
One should not see them as ordinary (<i>rags pa</i>) but as subtle (<i>phra ba</i>) or extremely subtle (<i>shin tu phra ba</i>) beings." DKR "All in the assembly, whether they realize it or not, are pervaded by the <a href="#buddha-nature">Buddha nature</a> just as sesame seeds are pervaded by oil... So all sentient beings are <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a>, visualized as <a href="#daka">dakas</a> and <a href="#dakini">dakinis</a> of the appropriate family. If both teacher and retinue are Buddhas, their <a href="#buddhafield">Buddhafield</a> is also pure and should be visualized as <a href="#akanistha">Akanistha</a> or another <a href="#pure-land">pure land</a>." NT
</details><br>

Or you can think that the place where the [Dharma](#dharma) is being taught is the Lotus-Light Palace of the [Glorious Copper-colored Mountain](#glorious-copper-colored-mountain), the teacher who teaches is [Padmasambhava of Oddiyana](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), and we, the audience, are the Eight [Vidyadharas](#vidyadhara), the [Twenty-five Disciples](#twenty-five-disciples), and the [dakas](#daka) and [dakinis](#dakini).

Or consider that this perfect place is the Eastern [Buddhafield](#buddhafield), [Manifest Joy](#manifest-joy), where the perfect teacher [Vajrasattva](#vajrasattva), the perfect [sambhogakaya](#sambhogakaya), is teaching the assembly of the divinities of the Vajra Family and male and female [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva).

Equally well, the perfect place where the [Dharma](#dharma) is being taught can be the Western Buddhafield, the Blissful, the perfect teacher the Buddha [Amitabha](#amitabha), and the assembly the male and female [Bodhisattvas](#bodhisattva) and [deities](#deity) of the Lotus family.

Whatever the case, the *teaching* is that of the [Great Vehicle](#great-vehicle) and the *time* is the ever-revolving wheel of eternity.

These visualizations<sup>[9](#9)</sup> are to help us understand how things are in reality. It is not that we are temporarily creating something that does not really exist.

<details id="9"><summary>Note <sup>9</sup></summary>
<i>gsal btab pa</i> means visualize but also to bring to mind, to have clearly in one's mind, to refresh one's memory. "Visualizing in this way does not mean telling oneself that a donkey is a horse or that a piece of coal is gold; it means having vividly in one's mind what has always been so from the beginning, that appearances and beings spring from the primal ground, which is the state of Buddhahood." NT
</details><br>

The teacher embodies the essence of all [Buddhas](#buddha) throughout the [three times](#three-times). He is the union of the [Three Jewels](#three-jewels): his body is the [Sangha](#sangha), his speech the [Dharma](#dharma), his mind the [Buddha](#buddha). He is the union of the [Three Roots](#three-roots): his body is the teacher, his speech the [yidam](#yidam), his mind the [dakini](#dakini). He is the union of the [three kayas](#three-kayas): his body is the [nirmanakaya](#nirmanakaya), his speech the [sambhogakaya](#sambhogakaya), his mind the [dharmakaya](#dharmakaya). He is the embodiment of all the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the past, source of all the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the future and the representative of all the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the present. Since he takes as his disciples degenerate beings like us, whom none of the thousand Buddhas of the [Good Kalpa](#good-kalpa)<sup>[10](#10)</sup> could help, his compassion and bounty exceed that of all [Buddhas](#buddha).

<details id="10"><summary>Note <sup>10</sup></summary>
"In this <a href="#kalpa">kalpa</a> a thousand <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a> are to appear. However, we have not met those <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a> who have already come&mdash;or if we did meet them they did not succeed in bringing us to liberation. As for the <a href="#buddha">Buddhas</a> of the future, it is still too soon for us to meet them. So without our spiritual teachers we would hav no one to help us." DKR
</details><br>

>The teacher is the [Buddha](#buddha), the teacher is the [Dharma](#dharma),  
The teacher is also the [Sangha](#sangha).  
The teacher is the one who accomplishes everything.  
The teacher is Glorious [Vajradhara](#vajradhara).

We, as the assembly gathered to listen to the teachings, use the basis of our own [Buddha-nature](#buddha-nature), the support of our precious human life, the circumstance of having a [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) and the method of following his advice, to become the [Buddhas](#buddha) of the future. As the *Hevajra Tantra* says:

> All beings are [Buddhas](#buddha),  
But this is concealed by adventitious stains.  
When their stains are purified, their Buddhahood is revealed.

### **2. Conduct**

The right conduct while listening to teachings is described in terms of [what to avoid](#21-what-to-avoid) and [what to do](#22-what-to-do).

#### 2.1 WHAT TO AVOID

Conduct to avoid includes the [three defects of the pot](#211-the-three-defects-of-the-pot), [the six stains](#212-the-six-stains) and [the five wrong ways of remembering](#213-the-five-wrong-ways-of-remembering).

##### 2.1.1 The Three Defects of the Pot

**1. Upside-down pot**

Not to listen is to be like a pot turned upside down.  

**2. Pot with a hole**

Not to be able to retain what you hear is to be like a pot with a hole in it.  

**3. Poison pot**

To mix negative emotions with what you hear is to be like a pot with poison in it.  

---

**1. Upside-down pot**

*The upside-down pot*. When you are listening to the teachings, listen to what is being said and do not let yourself be distracted by anything else. Otherwise you will be like an upside-down pot on which liquid is being poured. Although you are physically present, you do not hear a word of the teaching.

**2. Pot with a hole**

*The pot with a hole in it*. If you just listen without remembering anything that you hear or understand, you will be like a pot with a leak: however much liquid is poured into it, nothing can stay. No matter how many teachings you hear, you can never assimilate them or put them into practice.

**3. Poison pot**

*The pot containing poison*. If you listen to the teachings with the wrong attitude, such as the desire to become great or famous, or a mind full of the [five poisons](#five-poisons), the [Dharma](#dharma) will not only fail to help your mind; it will also be changed into something that is not [Dharma](#dharma) at all, like [nectar](#nectar) poured into a pot containing poison.

---

**1. Upside-down pot**

This is why the Indian sage, [Padampa Sangye](#padampa-sangye), said:
> Listen to the teachings like a deer listening to music;  
Contemplate them like a northern nomad shearing sheep;<sup>*</sup>  
Meditate on them like a dumb person savouring food;<sup>**</sup>  
Practice them like a hungry yak eating grass;  
Reach their result, like the sun coming out from behind the clouds.  
>
> <sup> *That is to say, meticulously, in their entirety, and without distraction.</sup>  
> <sup> **A dumb person can taste, but not describe the flavors they are tasting. In the same way, the taste of true meditation is beyond any description or concepts.</sup>

When listening to the teachings, you should be like a deer so entranced by the sound of the *[vina](#vina)* that it does not notice the hidden hunter shooting his poisoned arrow. Put your hands together palm to palm and listen, every pore on your body tingling and your eyes wet with tears, never letting any other thought get in the way.

It is no good listening with only your body physically present, while your mind wanders off after your thoughts and your speech lets loose a rich store of gossip, saying whatever you like and looking around everywhere. When listening to teachings, you should even stop reciting prayers, counting mantras, or whatever other meritorious activities you may be doing.

**2. Pot with a hole**

After you have listened properly to a teaching in this way, it is then also important to retain the meaning of what has been said without ever forgetting it, and to continually put it into practice. For, as the Great Sage himself said:

> I have shown you the methods  
That lead to liberation.  
But you should know  
That liberation depends upon yourself.

The teacher gives the disciple instructions explaining how to listen to the [Dharma](#dharma) and how to apply it, how to give up [negative actions](#negative-action), how to perform [positive ones](#positive-action), and how to practice. It is up to the disciple to remember those instructions, forgetting nothing; to put them into practice; and to realize them.

Just listening to the [Dharma](#dharma) is perhaps of some benefit by itself. But unless you remember what you hear, you will not have the slightest knowledge of either the words or the meaning of the teaching&mdash;which is no different from not having heard it at all.

**3. Poison pot**

If you remember the teachings but mix them with your [negative emotions](#negative-emotions), they will never be the pure [Dharma](#dharma). As the peerless [Dago Rinpoche](#dago-rinpoche) says:

> Unless you practice [Dharma](#dharma) according to the [Dharma](#dharma),  
[Dharma](#dharma) itself becomes the cause of evil rebirths.

Rid yourself of every wrong thought concerning the teacher and the [Dharma](#dharma), do not criticize or abuse your [spiritual companions](#spiritual-companions), be free of pride and contempt, abandon all bad thoughts. For all of these cause lower rebirths.

##### 2.1.2 The Six Stains

In the *Well Explained Reasoning*, it says:

> Pride, lack of faith and lack of effort,  
Outward distraction, inward tension and discouragement;  
These are the six stains.

Avoid these six: 

**1. Pride**

Proudly believing yourself superior to the teacher who is explaining the [Dharma](#dharma).

**2. Lack of faith**

Not trusting the master and their teachings.

**3. Lack of effort**

Failing to apply yourself to the [Dharma](#dharma).

**4. Outward distraction**

Getting distracted by external events.

**5. Inward tension**

Focussing your five senses too intently inwards.

**6. Discouragement**

Being discouraged if, for example, a teaching is too long.

---

**1. Pride**

Of all negative emotions, pride and jealousy are the most difficult to recognize. Therefore, examine your mind minutely. Any feeling that there is something even the least bit special about your own qualities, whether worldly or spiritual, will make you blind to your own faults and unaware of others' good qualities. So renounce pride and always take a low position.

**2. Lack of faith**

If you have no faith, the entrance to the [Dharma](#dharma) is blocked. Of the four types of faith,<sup>[11](#11)</sup> aim for faith that is irreversible.

<details id="11"><summary>Note <sup>11</sup></summary>
The first three are explained in <a href="#chapter-onetaking-refuge-the-foundation-stone-of-all-paths">Part Two, Chapter One</a>. A fourth, irreversible faith, is sometimes added to denote the culmination of faith, when it has become an integral part of one's being.
</details><br>

**3. Lack of effort**

Your interest<sup>[12](#12)</sup> in the [Dharma](#dharma) is the basis of what you will achieve. So depending on whether your degree of interest is superior, middling or inferior you will become a superior, middling or inferior practitioner. And if you are not at all interested in the [Dharma](#dharma), there will be no results at all. As the proverb puts it:

<details id="12"><summary>Note <sup>12</sup></summary>
NT says "Whether or not we have received the Dharma, if we have no interest in it we will be like a horse who is offered a bone, or a dog presented with grass" <i>don gnyer</i>, "interest," also means "effort," that is to say, not only intellectual interest but also active engagement.
</details><br>

> The [Dharma](#dharma) is nobody's property. It belongs to whoever has the most endeavour.

The Buddha himself obtained the teachings at the price of hundreds of hardships. To obtain a single four-line verse, he gouged holes in his own flesh to serve as offering lamps, filling them with oil and planting in them thousands of burning wicks. He leapt into flaming pits, and drove a thousand iron nails into his body.<sup>[13](#13)</sup>

<details id="13"><summary>Note <sup>13</sup></summary>
These examples from stories of the Buddha's previous lives serve to illustrate the degree of his commitment and should not be taken as recommending extreme asceticism. 
</details><br>

> Even if you have to face blazing infernos or razor-sharp blades,  
Search for the [Dharma](#dharma) until you die.

Listen to the teachings, therefore, with great effort, ignoring heat, cold and all other trials.

**4. Outward distraction**

The tendency of consciousness to get engrossed in the objects of the six senses<sup>[14](#14)</sup> is the root of all [samsara's](#samsara) hallucinations and the source of all suffering. This is how the moth dies in the lamp-flame, because its visual consciousness is attracted to forms; how the stag is killed by the hunter, because its hearing draws it to sounds; how bees are swallowed by carnivorous plants, seduced by their smell; how fish are caught with bait, their sense of taste lured by its flavor; how elephants drown in the swamp because they love the physical feeling of mud. In the same way, whenever you are listening to the [Dharma](#dharma), teaching, meditating or practicing, it is important not to follow tendencies from the past, not to entertain emotions about the future and not to let your present thoughts get distracted by anything around you . As [Gyalse Rinpoche](#gyalse-rinpoche) says:

<details id="14"><summary>Note <sup>14</sup></summary>
The sixth sense is mind, since the same psychological reactions are produced by objects which simply arise in thought as by objects perceived by the five physical sense.
</details><br>

> Your past joys and sorrows are like drawings on water:  
No trace of them remains. Don't run after them!  
But should they come to mind, reflect on how success and failure come and go.  
Is there anything you can trust besides [Dharma](#dharma), mani-reciters?<sup>[15](#15)</sup>
>
><details id="15"><summary>Note <sup>15</sup></summary>This refers to ordinary Tibetans, who characteristically have faith in the Dharma and recite the well known mantra, <i>Om mani padme hum</i>, but who may not have any detailed knowledge of the Buddhist teachings. Here Gyalse Rinpoche is using the term in a slightly derogatory way to provoke his listeners.</details><br>
>
> Your future projects and plans are like nets cast in a dry riverbed:   
They'll never bring what you want. Limit your desires and aspirations!  
But should they come to mind, think how uncertain it is when you'll die:  
Have you got time for anything other than [Dharma](#dharma), mani-reciters?
>
> Your present work is like a job in a dream.  
Since all such effort is pointless, cast it aside.  
Consider even your honest earnings without any attachment.  
Activities are without essence, mani-reciters!
> 
> Between meditation sessions, learn to control in this way all thoughts arising from the [three poisons](#three-poisons);  
Until all thoughts and perceptions arise as the [dharmakaya](#dharmakaya),  
This is indispensable&mdash;remembering it whenever you need it,  
Do not give rein to deluded thoughts, mani-reciters!

It also said:

> Don't invite the future. If you do,  
You're like the father of Famous Moon!

This refers to the story of a poor man who came across a large pile of barley. He put it in a big sack, tied it to a rafter, and then lay down beneath it and started to day-dream.

"This barley is going to make me really rich," he thought. "Once I'm rich, I'll get myself a wife... She's bound to have a boy... What shall I call him?"

Just then, the moon appeared and he decided to call his son Famous Moon. However, all this time a rat had been gnawing away at the rope that was holding up the sack. The rope suddenly snapped, the sack fell on the man and he was killed. 

Such dreams about the past and future will never come to fruition and are only a distraction. Give them up altogether. Be mindful and listen with attention and care.

Do not focus too intently, picking out individual words and points, like a *dremo* bear digging up marmots&mdash;each time you seize one item, you forget the one before, and will never get to understand the whole. **Too much concentration also makes you sleepy. Instead keep a balance between tight and loose.**

Once, in the past, [Ananda](#ananda) was teaching [Srona](#srona-sronajat) to meditate. Srona had great difficulty getting it right. Sometimes he was too tense, sometimes too relaxed. Srona went to discuss the matter with the Buddha, who asked him: "When you were a layman, you were a good *[vina](#vina)*-player, weren't you?"

"Yes, I played very well."

"Did your *vina* sound best when the strings were very slack or when they were very taut?"

"It sounded best when they were neither too taut nor too loose."

"It is the same for your mind," said the Buddha; and by practicing with that advice [Srona](#srona-sronajat) attained his goal.

[Machik Labdron](#machik-labdron) says:

> Be firmly concentrated and loosely relaxed:<sup>[16](#16)</sup>  
Here is an essential point for the View.

<details id="16"><summary>Note <sup>16</sup></summary>
<i>grims kyis sgrim la lhod kyis glod</i>. "This means without distraction, but very relaxed at the same time." DKR. Furthermore, at first it is necessary to rein in the wild thoughts to achieve sustained calm (<i>zhi gnas</i>), then one has to relax the mind to allow the expansion of profound insight (<i>lhag mthong</i>).
</details><br>


**5. Inward tension** 


Do not let your mind get too tense or too inwardly concentrated; let your senses be naturally at ease, balanced between tension and relaxation.

**6. Discouragement**

You should not tire of listening to the teachings. Do not feel discouraged when you get hungry or thirsty during a teaching that goes on too long, or when you have to put up with discomfort caused by the wind, sun, rain and so forth. Just be glad that you now have the freedoms and advantages of human life, that you have met an authentic teacher, and that you can listen to their profound instructions.

The fact that you are at this moment listening to the profound [Dharma](#dharma) is the fruit of [merits](#merit) accumulated over innumerable [kalpas](#kalpa). It is like eating a meal when you have only eaten once every hundred mealtimes throughout your life. So it is imperative to listen with joy, vowing to bear heat, cold and whatever trials and difficulties might arise, in order to receive these teachings.

##### 2.1.3 The Five Wrong Ways of Remembering

> Avoid remembering the words but forgetting the meaning,  
Or remembering the meaning but forgetting the words.  
Avoid remembering both but with no understanding,  
Remembering them out of order, or remembering them incorrectly.

**1. Avoid remembering the words but forgetting the meaning**

Do not attach undue importance to elegant turns of phrase without making any attempt to analyze the profound meaning of the words, like a child gathering flowers. Words alone are of no benefit for the mind. 

**2. Avoid remembering the meaning but forgetting the words**

On the other hand, do not disregard the way in which the teachings are expressed, as being just the words and therefore dispensable. For then, even if you grasp the profound meaning, you will no longer have the means through which to express it. Words and meaning will have lost their connection.<sup>[17](#17)</sup>

<details id="17"><summary>Note <sup>17</sup></summary>
"That the way the teachings are expressed are just the words and therefore dispensable is what people say who think they are great [Nyingmapa](#nyingmapa) meditators. They think that they can grasp the essential naked meaning without bothering about the words. Pointing to their hearts they will say that this explanation is just words which have no substance and that it is only necessary to understand the essence of mind."
</details><br>

**3. Avoid remembering both but with no understanding**

If you remember the teaching without identifying the different levels&mdash;the expedient meaning, the real meaning and the indirect meaning&mdash;you will be confused about what the words refer to.<sup>[18](#18)</sup> This may lead you away from the true [Dharma](#dharma). 

**4. Avoid remembering them out of order**

If you remember it out of order, you will mix up the proper sequence of the teaching, and every time you listen to it, explain it, or meditate on it the confusion will be multiplied.  

**5. Avoid remembering them incorrectly**

If you remember incorrectly what has been said, endless wrong ideas will proliferate.<sup>[19](#19)</sup> This will spoil your mind and debase the teaching. Avoid all these errors and remember everything&mdash;(1)&ndash;the words, (2)&ndash;the meaning and (4)&ndash;the order of the teachings&mdash;(3)&ndash;properly and (5)&ndash;without any mistake.

<details id="18"><summary>Note <sup>18</sup></summary>
The real meaning expresses the truth from the point of view of realized beings. The expedient meaning refers to teachings intended to lead unrealized beings towards that truth, who would not be able to accept or understand it if it was stated directly. The indirect meaning refers to teachings given to beings to introduce them indirectly to a meaning which is not directly stated.
</details>

<details id="19"><summary>Note <sup>19</sup></summary>
"That is misunderstanding the meaning, imagining, for instance, that from the moment when one has received the teaching of the <a href="#secret-mantrayana">Secret Mantrayana</a> one can enjoy sex and alcohol, and perform the practices of union and liberation. To avoid this mistake, one's conduct should be appropriate to the moment (i.e. to the level of spiritual evolution that we have actually reached at the present moment)."
</details><br>

However long and difficult the teaching may be, do not feel disheartened and wonder if it will ever end; persevere. And however short and simple it may be, do not undervalue it as just elementary.

To remember both (1)&ndash;words and (2)&ndash;meaning (5)&ndash;perfectly, (4)&ndash;in the right order and (3)&ndash;with everything properly linked together, is therefore indispensable.

#### 2.2 WHAT TO DO

The conduct to be adopted while listening to teachings is explained as the [four metaphors](#221-the-four-metaphors). [the six transcendent perfections](#222-the-six-transcendent-perfections), and [other modes of conduct](#223-other-mods-of-conduct).

##### 2.2.1 The Four Metaphors

*The Sutra Arranged like a Tree says:*

> Noble one, you should think of yourself as someone who is sick,  
Of the [Dharma](#dharma) as the remedy,  
Of your [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) as a skilful doctor,  
And of diligent practice as the way to recovery.

**1. We are sick**

From beginningless time, in this immense ocean of suffering that is [samsara](#samsara), we have been tormented by the illness of the [three poisons](#three-poisons) and their fruit, the three kinds of suffering.

**2. Dharma is the medicine**

When people are seriously ill, they go to consult a good doctor. They follow the doctor's advice, take whatever medicine they prescribe, and do all they can to overcome the disease and get well. In the same way, you should cure yourself of the diseases of [karma](#karma), [negative emotions](#negative-emotions) and suffering by following the prescriptions of that experienced doctor, the authentic teacher, and by taking the medicine of the [Dharma](#dharma).

**3. Our teacher is the doctor**

Following a teacher without doing what they say is like disobeying your doctor, which leaves them no chance of treating your illness. Not taking the medicine of the [Dharma](#dharma)&mdash;that is to say, not putting it into practice&mdash;is like having innumerable medications and prescriptions beside your bed but never touching them. That will never cure your disease.

**4. Practice leads to recovery**

These days, people say full of optimism, "Lama, look on me with compassion!" thinking that even if they have done many terrible things, they will never have to endure the consequences. They reckon that the teacher, in their compassion, will toss them up into the heavenly realms as if they were throwing a pebble. But when we speak of the teacher holding us with their compassion, what this really means is that they have lovingly accepted us as disciples, and that they give us their profound instructions, opens our eyes to what to do and what not to do and shows us the way to liberation taught by the [Conqueror](#conqueror). What greater compassion could there be? It is up to us whether or not we take advantage of this compassion and actually pursue the path of liberation.

Now that we have this free and well-endowed human birth, now that we know what we should and should not do, our decision at this juncture, when we have the freedom to choose, marks the turning-point which will determine our fate, for better or worse, far into the future.<sup>[20](#20)</sup> It is crucial that we choose between [samsara](#samsara) and [nirvana](#nirvana) once and for all and put the instructions of our teacher into practice.

<details id="20"><summary>Note <sup>20</sup></summary>
AT "an inspiration which is good or bad forever." Here we have followed the explanation of DKR.
</details><br>

Those who conduct village ceremonies will have you believe that on your death-bed you can still go up or down, as if you were steering a horse by the reins. But by that time, unless you have already mastered the path, the fierce [wind](#wind) of your past actions will be chasing after you, while in front a terrifying black darkness rushes toward you as you are driven helplessly down the long and perilous path of the [intermediate state](#intermediate-state). The Lord of Death's countless henchmen will be pursuing you, crying, "Kill! Kill! Strike! Strike!" How could such a moment&mdash;when there is no place to run to and nowhere to hide, no refuge and no hope, when you are desperate and have no idea what to do&mdash;how could such a moment be the turning point at which you control whether you go up or down? As the Great One of Oddiyana says:

> By the time empowerment is being given to the card marked with your name,<sup>[21](#21)</sup> it's too late! Your consciousness, already wandering in the intermediate state like a dazed dog, will find it very hard to even think of higher realms.
>
><details id="21"><summary>Note <sup>21</sup></summary>This refers to a purification practice for the dead in which the dead person is represented by a card bearing their name.</details>
<br>

In fact the turning point, the only time that you really can direct yourself up or down as if steering a horse with the reins, is right now, while you are still alive.

As a human being, your positive actions are more powerful than those of other kinds of being. This gives you, on the one hand, an opportunity here and now in this very life to cast rebirth aside once and for all.<sup>[22](#22)</sup> But (**1**)&ndash;your negative actions are more powerful too; thus you are also quite capable of making sure, on the other hand, that you will never get free from the depths of the lower realms. So now that (**3**)&ndash;you have met the teacher, the skilful doctor, and (**2**)&ndash;the [Dharma](#dharma), the elixir that conquers death, (**4**)&ndash;this is the moment to apply the four metaphors, putting the teachings you have heard into practice, and traveling the path of liberation.

<details id="22"><summary>Note <sup>22</sup></summary>
The expression <i>thod pa bor chog ma</i> literally means "getting rid of the skull," that is, of getting rid of one's body, in the sense of freeing oneself from future rebirths. DKR
</details><br>

The *Treasury of Precious Qualities* describes four wrong notions that must be avoided, which are the opposite of the four metaphors we have mentioned:

> Shallow-tongued men with evil natures  
Approach the teacher as if he were a musk-deer.  
Having extracted the musk, the perfect [Dharma](#dharma),  
Full of joy, they sneer at the [samaya](#samaya).

Such people behave as though their (**3**)&ndash;spiritual teacher were a musk-deer, the (**2**)&ndash;[Dharma](#dharma) were the musk, (**1**)&ndash;they themselves the hunters, and (**4**)&ndash;intense practice the way to kill the deer with an arrow or a trap. They do not practice the teachings they have received and feel no gratitude toward the teacher. They use [Dharma](#dharma) to accumulate evil actions, which will drag them down like a millstone to the lower realms.

##### 2.2.2 The Six Transcendent Perfections

In the *Tantra of Thorough Comprehension of the Instructions on all Dharma Practices*, it says:

> Make excellent offerings such as flowers and cushions ***(generosity)***,  
Put the place in order and control your behavior ***(discipline)***,  
Do not harm any living being ***(patience)***,  
Have genuine faith in your teacher ***(diligence)***,  
Listen to his instructions without distraction ***(concentration)***  
And question him in order to dispel your doubts; ***(wisdom)***  
These are the six transcendent perfections of a listener.

A person listening to the teaching should practice the six transcendent perfections as follows:

**1. Make excellent offerings**

Prepare the teacher's seat, arrange cushions upon it, offer a mandala, flowers and other offerings, This is the practice of ***generosity***.

**2. Clean the place and behave**

Sweep clean the place or room after carefully settling the dust with water, and refrain from all disrespectful conduct. This is the practice of ***discipline***.

**3. Harm nothing**

Avoid harm to living beings, even the smallest of insects, and bear heat, cold and all other difficulties. This is the practice of ***patience***.

**4. Listen joyfully and faithfully**

Lay aside any wrong views concerning the teacher and the teaching and listen joyfully with genuine faith. This is the practice of ***diligence***.

**5. Listen without distraction**

Listen to the [Lama's](#lama) instructions without distraction. This is the practice of ***concentration***.

**6. Understand clearly**

Ask questions to clear up any hesitations and doubts. This is the practice of ***wisdom***.

##### 2.2.3 Other Mods of Conduct

All forms of disrespectful behavior should be avoided. The *Vinaya* says:

> Do not teach those who have no respect,  
Who cover their heads although in good health,  
Who carry canes, weapons and parasols,  
Or whose heads are swathed in turbans.

and the *Jatakas*:

> Take the lowest seat.  
Cultivate the dignified bearing of thorough discipline.  
With your eyes brimming with joy,  
Drink in the words like nectar  
And be completely concentrated.  
That is the way to listen to the teaching.

## II. THE TEACHING ITSELF: AN EXPLANATION OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIND THE FREEDOMS AND ADVANTAGES

The main subject of the chapter is explained in four sections: [reflecting on the nature of freedom](#1-reflecting-on-the-nature-of-freedom), [reflecting on the particular advantages related to Dharma](#2-reflecting-on-the-particular-advantages-related-to-dharma), [reflecting on images that show how difficult it is to find the freedoms and advantages](#3-reflecting-on-images-that-show-how-difficult-it-is-to-find-the-freedoms-and-advantages), and [reflecting on numerical comparisons](#4-reflecting-on-numerical-comparisons).

### **1. Reflecting on the nature of freedom**

In general, here, "freedom" means to have the opportunity to practice [Dharma](#dharma) and not to be born in one of the eight states without that opportunity. "Lack of freedom" refers to those eight states where there is no such opportunity:

> Being born in the **[hells](#hell)**, in the **[preta](#preta) realm**,  
As an **animal**, a **long-lived [god](#gods)** or a **barbarian**,  
Having **wrong views**, being born when **there is no [Buddha](#buddha)**  
Or being **born deaf and mute**; these are the eight states without freedom.

**1. Hell**

Beings reborn in [hell](#hell) have no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma) because they are constantly tormented by intense heat or cold.

**2. The pretas**

The *[pretas](#preta)* have no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma) because of the suffering they experience from hunger and thirst.

**3. Animals**

Animals have no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma) because they undergo slavery and suffer from the attacks of other animals.

**4. Gods**

The long-lived [gods](#gods) have no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma) because they spend their time in a state of mental blankness.<sup>[23](#23)</sup>

<details id="23"><summary>Note <sup>23</sup></summary>
*'du shes med pa*. AT "without perception." We have followed the explanation of DKR: "The gods without perception have created a blankness in their minds and perceive nothing, as in the state of deep sleep without dreams."
</details><br>

**5. Barbarians**  
**6. Wrong views**  
**7. No Buddha**

Those born as *[tirthikas](#tirthika)* or with similar wrong views have no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma) because they never even hear of the [Three Jewels](#three-jewels), and cannot distinguish good from bad.

**8. Mentally deficient**

Those born mute or mentally deficient have no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma) because their faculties are incomplete.

---

**1. Hell**  
**2. The pretas**  
**3. Animals**  

The inhabitants of the three lower realms suffer constantly from heat, cold, hunger, thirst and other torments, as a result of their past negative actions; they have no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma).

**5. Barbarians**

"Barbarians" means those who live in the thirty-two border countries, such as Lo Khatha,<sup>[24](#24)</sup> and all those who consider harming others as an act of faith or whose savage beliefs see taking life as good. These people inhabiting the outlying territories have human form, but their minds lack the right orientation and they cannot attune themselves to the [Dharma](#dharma). Inheriting from their forefathers such pernicious customs as marriage to their mothers, they live in a way that is the very opposite of [Dharma](#dharma) practice. Everything they do is evil, and it is in techniques of such harmful activities as killing insects and hunting wild beasts that they truly excel. Many of them fall into lower realms as soon as they die. For such people there is no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma).

<details id="24"><summary>Note <sup>24</sup></summary>
*klo kha khra* refers to the large area inhabited by tribal peoples lying to the south of central and eastern Tibet. It includes present-day Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and parts of Assam in north-eastern India, as well as parts of north-western Burma.
</details><br>

**4. Gods**

The long-lived [gods](#gods) are those gods who are absorbed in a state of mental blankness. Beings are born in this realm as a result of believing that liberation is a state in which all mental activities, good or bad, are absent, and of meditating upon that state. They remain in such states of concentration for great [kalpas](#kalpa) on end. But once the effect of the past actions that produced that condition has exhausted itself they are reborn in the lower realms because of their wrong views. They, too, lack any opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma).

**6. Wrong views**

The term "[wrong views](#wrong-view)" includes, in general, eternalist and nihilist beliefs, which are views contrary to, and outside, the teaching of the Buddha. Such views spoil our minds and prevent us from aspiring to the authentic [Dharma](#dharma), to the extent that we no longer have the opportunity to practice it. Here in Tibet, because the second Buddha, [Padmasambhava of Oddiyana](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), entrusted the protection of the land to the twelve [Tenma](#tenma), the [tirthikas](#tirthika) themselves have not really been able to penetrate. However, anyone whose understanding is like that of the [tirthikas](#tirthika), and contrary to that of the authentic [Dharma](#dharma) and authentic masters, will thereby be deprived of the opportunity to practice according to those true teachings. The monk [Sunaksatra](#sunaksatra) spent twenty-five years as Lord Buddha's attendant, and yet, because he did not have the slightest faith and held only wrong views, ended up being reborn as a [preta](#preta) in a flower-garden.

**7. No Buddha**

Birth in a dark [kalpa](#kalpa) means to be reborn in a period during which there is no [Buddha](#buddha). In a universe where no [Buddha](#buddha) has appeared, no-one has ever even heard of the [Three Jewels](#three-jewels). As there is no [Dharma](#dharma), there is no opportunity to practice it.

**8. Mental deficiency**

The mind of a person born deaf and mute cannot function properly and the process of listening to the teachings, expounding them, reflecting on them and putting them into practice is impeded. The description "def mute" usually refers to a speech dysfunction. It becomes a condition without the opportunity for [Dharma](#dharma) when the usual human ability to use and understand language is absent. This category therefore also includes those whose mental disability makes them unable to comprehend the teachings and thus deprives them of the opportunity to practice them.

### **2. Reflecting on the particular advantages related to Dharma**

Under this heading are included [five individual advantages](#21-the-five-individual-advantages) and [five circumstantial advantages](#22-the-five-circumstantial-advantages).

#### 2.1 THE FIVE INDIVIDUAL ADVANTAGES

[Nagarjuna](#nagarjuna) lists them as follows:

> Born a human, in a central place, with all one's faculties,  
Without a conflicting lifestyle and with faith in the [Dharma](#dharma).

**1. Born a human**

Without a human life, it would not be possible even to encounter the [Dharma](#dharma). So this human body is the advantage of ***support***.

**2. In a central place**

Had you been born in a remote place where [Dharma](#dharma) was unheard of, you would never have come across it. But the region you were born in is central as far as [Dharma](#dharma) is concerned and so you have the advantage of ***place***.

**3. With all one's faculties**

Not to have all your sense faculties intact would be a hindrance to the practice of [Dharma](#dharma). If you are free of such disabilities, you have the advantage of ***possessing the sense faculties***.

**4. Without a conflicting lifestyle**

If you had a conflicting lifestyle, you would always be immersed in negative actions and at variance with the [Dharma](#dharma). Since you now have the wish to do positive actions, this is the advantage of ***intention***.

**5. With faith in the Dharma**

If you had no faith in the Buddha's teachings you would not feel any inclination for the Dharma. Having the ability to turn your mind to the Dharma, as you are doing now, constitutes the advantage of ***faith***.

Because these five advantages need to be complete with regard to one's own make-up, they are called the ***[five individual advantages](#21-the-five-individual-advantages)***.

**1. Born a human**

To practice the real, authentic [Dharma](#dharma), it is absolutely necessary to be a human being. Now suppose that you did not have the support of a human form, but had the highest form of life in the three lower realms, that of an animal&mdash;even the most beautiful and highly prized animal known to man. If someone said to you, "Say *Om mani padme hum* once, and you will become a [Buddha](#buddha)," you would be quite incapable of understanding his words or grasping their meaning, nor would you be able to utter a word.l In fact, even if you were dying of cold, you would be unable to think of anything to do but lie in a heap&mdash;whereas a man, no matter how weak, would know how to shelter in a cave or under a tree, and would gather wood and make a fire to warm his face and hands. If animals are incapable of even such simple things, how could they ever conceive of practicing [Dharma](#dharma)?

[Gods](#gods) and other beings of the kind, however superior their physical form, do not meet the requirements laid down for taking the *[pratimoksa](#pratimoksa) vows, and therefore cannot assimilate the [Dharma](#dharma) in its totality.

**2. In a central place**

As to what is meant by a "central region," one should distinguish between a geographically central region and a place that is central in terms of the [Dharma](#dharma).

Geographically speaking, the central region is generally said to be the [Vajra Seat](#vajra-seat) at Bodh Gaya<sup>[25](#25)</sup> in India, at the centre of [Jambudvipa](#jambudvipa), the Southern Continent. The thousand Buddhas of the [Good Kalpa](#good-kalpa) all attain [enlightenment](#enlightenment) there. Even in the universal destruction at the end of the [kalpa](#kalpa), the four elements cannot harm it, and it remains there as if suspended in space. At its centre grows the Tree of Enlightenment. This place, with all the towns of India around it, is therefore considered the central region in terms of geography.

<details id="25"><summary>Note <sup>25</sup></summary>
Tibetans habitually call Bodh Gaya <i>rdo rje ldan</i>, the Vajra Seat, referring to the spot on which the Buddha sat when he attained enlightenment. It is considered to be the centre of the world.
</details><br>

In [Dharma](#dharma) terms, a central place is wherever the [Dharma](#dharma)&mdash;the teaching of Lord Buddha&mdash;exists. All other regions are said to be peripheral.

In the distant past, from the time Lord Buddha came into this world and as long as his doctrine still existed in India, that land was central in terms of both geography and [Dharma](#dharma). However, now that it has fallen into the hands of the [tirthikas](#tirthika) and the doctrine of the Conqueror has disappeared in that region, as far as [Dharma](#dharma) is concerned even Bodh Gaya is a peripheral place.

In the days of the Buddha, Tibet, the Land of Snows, was called 'the border country of Tibet," because it was a sparsely populated land to which the doctrine had not yet spread. Later, the population increased little by little, and there reigned several kings who were emanations of the Buddhas. The [Dharma](#dharma) first appeared in Tibet during the reign of Lha-Thothori Nyentsen, when the *Sutra of a Hundred Invocations and Prostrations*, a *[tsa-tsa](#tsa-tsa)* mould and other objects fell on the palace roof.

Five generations later, in accordance with prophecies that he would understand the meaning of the sutra, there appeared the Dharma King [Songtsen Gampo](#songtsen-gampo), an emanation of the Sublime Compassionate One.<sup>*</sup> During [Songtsen Gampo's](#songtsen-gampo) reign, the translator Thonmi Sambhota was sent to India to study its languages and scripts. On his return he introduced an alphabet to Tibet for the first time. He translated into Tibetan twenty-one [sutras](#sutra) and [tantras](#tantra) of [Avalokitesvara](#avalokitesvara), *The Powerful Secret*, and various other texts. The king himself displayed multiple forms, and along with his minister Gartongtsen, he used miraculous means to defend the country. He took as his queens two princesses, one Chinese and one from Nepal, who brought with them numerous representations of the Buddha's body, speech and mind including the statues called the Jowo Mikyo Dorje and the Jowo Sakyamuni, the actual representatives of the Buddha.<sup>[26](#26)</sup> The king built the series of temples known as the Thadul and Yangdul, of which the principal one was the Rasa Trulnang.<sup>[27](#27)</sup> In this way he established Buddhism in Tibet.

<sup>* Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.</sup>

<details id="26"><summary>Note <sup>26</sup></summary>
Same as note <sup><a href="#295">295</a></sup>: Princess Wen-Ch'eng Kung-chu, Kongjo to the Tibetans, was the daughter of the T'ang emperor T'ai-tsung. The statue she brought was of [Sakyamuni Buddha](#sakyamuni) at the age of twelve, and had been presented to the Chinese emperor by a Buddhist king of Bengal; the Ramoche temple was built in 641 to house it but it was later moved to the Rasa Trulnang (Jokhang), where it is now&mdash;the famous Jowo Rinpoche. Queen Tritsun was the daughter of the Nepalese king Amsuvarman; the statue she brought was of [Buddha Sakyamuni](#sakyamuni) at the age of eight is now in the Ramoche Temple.
</details>

<details id="27"><summary>Note <sup>27</sup></summary>
These temples were constructed at precise points to subdue the negative forces of Tibet. At the heart of the group was the Rasa Trulnang, the original name for the Jokhang. See also <a href="#iv-propagation-of-the-essence-teaching-in-tibet-land-of-snows">IV. PROPAGATION OF THE ESSENCE-TEACHING IN TIBET, LAND OF SNOWS</a> and note <sup><a href="#294">294</a></sup>: The <i>gtsug lag khang</i> or central temple of Lhasa, the Rasa Trulnang, nowadays known as the Jokhang, could only be built after the construction of the four Thadul (<i>mtha' 'dul</i>) or Border-Taming and four Yangdul (,i.yang 'dul</i>) or Outer Border-Taming temples, and other temples, on geomantically important sites around Tibet and its borders. For details fo the story sites, see HIST, Vol. 1, page 510 and notes.
</details><br>

His fifth successor, [King Trisong Detsen](#trisong-detsen), invited one hundred and eight pandits to Tibet, including [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana), the Preceptor of Oddiyana, the greatest of the mantra-holders, unequalled throughout the three worlds. To uphold representations of the Buddha's form, [Trisong Detsen](#trisong-detsen) had temples built, including "unchanging, spontaneously arisen" [Samye](#samye). To uphold the Buddha's speech, the authentic [Dharma](#dharma) one hundred and eight translators, including the great [Vairotsana](#vairotsana), learned the art of translation and translated all the main [sutras](#sutra), [tantras](#tantra) and [sastras](#sastra) then current in the noble land of India. The "Seven Men for Testing" and others were ordained as monks, forming the [Sangha](#sangha), to uphold the Buddha's mind.

From that time onwards up to the present day, the teachings of the [Buddha](#buddha) have shone like the sun in Tibet and, despite ups and downs, the doctrine of the Conqueror has never been lost in either of its aspects, transmission or realization. Thus Tibet, as far as the [Dharma](#dharma) is concerned, is a central country.

**3. With all one's faculties**

A person lacking any of the five sense faculties does not meet the requirements laid down for taking the monastic vows. Moreover, someone who does not have the good fortune to be able to see representations of the Conqueror to inspire his devotion, or to read and hear the precious and excellent teachings as the material for study and reflection, will not be fully capable of receiving the [Dharma](#dharma).

**4. Without a conflicting lifestyle**

"Conflicting lifestyle" refers, strictly speaking, to the lifestyles of people born in communities of hunters, prostitutes and so forth, who are involved in these negative activities from their earliest youth. But in fact it also includes anyone whose every thought, word and deed is contrary to the [Dharma](#dharma)&mdash;for even those not born into such lifestyles can easily slip into them later in life. It is therefore essential to avoid doing anything which conflicts with the authentic [Dharma](#dharma).

**5. With faith in the Dharma**

If your faith is not in the [Buddha's](#buddha) teachings but in powerful [gods](#gods), [nagas](#naga) and so forth, or in other doctrines such as those of the [tirthikas](#tirthika), then, no matter how much faith you might place in them, none of them can protect you from the sufferings of [samsara](#samsara) or from rebirth in lower realms. But if you have acquired a properly reasoned faith in the Conqueror's doctrine, which unites transmission and realization, you are without doubt a fit vessel for the true [Dharma](#dharma). And that is the greatest of the five individual advantages.

#### 2.2 THE FIVE CIRCUMSTANTIAL ADVANTAGES

> A [Buddha](#buddha) has appeared and has preached the [Dharma](#dharma)  
His teachings still exist and can be followed,  
There are those who are kind-hearted towards others.

**1. A Buddha has appeared**

Those not born in a [bright kalpa](#good-kalpa), one in which a [Buddha](#buddha) has appeared, have never even heard of the [Dharma](#dharma). But we are now in a [kalpa](#kalpa) in which a [Buddha](#buddha) has come, and so we possess the advantage of the presence of the particular *teacher*.

**2. They have preached the Dharma**

Although a [Buddha](#buddha) has come, if they had not taught no-one would benefit. But since the Buddha turned the [Wheel of Dharma](#wheel-of-dharma) according to three levels, we have the advantage of the *teaching of the Dharma*.

**3. The teachings still exist**

Although they have taught, had their doctrine died out it would no longer be there to help us. But the period during which the doctrine will remain extant has not yet ended, so we have the advantage of the *time*.

**4. The teachings can be followed**

Although the teachings still exist, unless we follow them they can be of no benefit to us. But since we have taken up the [Dharma](#dharma), we possess the advantage of *our own good fortune*.

**5. There are spiritual friends who can teach us**

Although we have taken up the [Dharma](#dharma), without the favorable circumstance of being accepted by a [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) we would never come to know what the [Dharma](#dharma) is really about. But since a [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) has accepted us, we possess the advantage of their *extraordinary compassion*.

Because these five factors need to be complete with regard to circumstances other than one's own, they are called the *[five circumstantial advantages](#22-the-five-circumstantial-advantages)*

**1. A Buddha has appeared**

The time it takes for the universe to form, to stay in existence, to be destroyed and to remain in a state of [emptiness](#emptiness) is called a [kalpa](#kalpa). A [kalpa](#kalpa) in which a perfect [Buddha](#buddha) appears in the world is called a "[bright kalpa](#good-kalpa);" while one in which a [Buddha](#buddha) does not appear is called a "dark kalpa." Long ago, during the great [Kalpa](#kalpa) of Manifest Joy, thirty-three thousand [Buddhas](#buddha) appeared. A hundred dark kalpas followed. Then, during the Perfect Kalpa, eight hundred million Buddhas appeared, again followed by a hundred kalpas without [Dharma](#dharma). Then eight hundred and forty million [Buddhas](#buddha) appeared during the Excellent Kalpa, after which there were five hundred dark kalpas. During the Kalpa Delightful to See, eight hundred million Buddhas appeared, and then there were seven hundred kalpas of darkness. Sixty thousand Buddhas appeared during the Joyous Kalpa. Then came our own kalpa, the Good Kalpa.

Before our [kalpa](#kalpa) arose, this cosmos of a billion universes was an immense ocean on whose surface appeared a thousand thousand-petalled lotuses. The [gods](#gods) of the Brahma-world, wondering how this could be, through clairvoyance understood it to signify that during this [kalpa](#kalpa) one thousand [Buddhas](#buddhas) would appear. "This will be a good [kalpa](#kalpa)," they said, and "Good" became its name.

From the time when beings' lifespan was eighty thousand years and the Buddha Destroyer-of-Samsara appeared, and up to the time when beings will live incalculably long and the Buddha Infinite-Aspiration will come, one thousand [Buddhas](#buddha) will have taken their place in this world, on the [Vajra Seat](#vajra-seat) at the center of the Continent of Jambudvipa. Each one of them will have attained perfect Buddhahood there and turned the [Wheel of Dharma](#wheel-of-dharma). Therefore our present [kalpa](#kalpa) is a [bright kalpa](#good-kalpa).

It will be followed by sixty peripheral, bad kalpas, and after that, in the Kalpa of Vast Numbers, ten thousand Buddhas will appear. Then another ten thousand bad kalpas will ensue. In this alternation of bright and dark kalpas, should we happen to be born during a dark kalpa, we would never even hear that there was such a thing as the [Three Jewels](#three-jewels).

Moreover, as the Great on of Oddiyana points out, the [Secret Mantra](#secret-mantrayana) [Vajrayana](#vajrayana) in particular is taught only rarely:

> Long ago, during the very first [kalpa](#kalpa), the Kalpa of the Complete Array, the teachings of the [Secret Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana) were promulgated by the [Buddha](#buddha) known as [Once-Come-King](#once-come-king) and achieved great renown. The teachings we have now, those of the present [Buddha Sakyamuni](#sakyamuni), also include the [Secret Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana). In ten million [kalpas'](#kalpa) time, during the Kalpa of the Array of Flowers, the Buddha Manjursri will come, as I have come now, to reveal the [Secret Mantra](#secret-mantrayana) teachings on a vast scale. This is so because beings in these three kalpas are suitable recipients for the Secret Mantras, and the reason why the Mantrayana teachings do not appear at other times is because the beings of those times are not capable of making use of them.<sup>[28](#28)</sup>

<details id="28"><summary>Note <sup>28</sup></summary>
According to NT Padmasambhava means that only in these three periods is the Secret Mantra Vajrayana revealed on a large scale.
</details><br>

In this [Good Kalpa](#good-kalpa), at the present time when the span of human life is a hundred years, the perfect [Buddha Sakyamuni](#sakyamuni) has come to the world, and so it is a [bright kalpa](#good-kalpa).

**2. They have preached the Dharma**

Suppose that a [Buddha](#buddha) had come, but was still in meditation and had not yet taught the [Dharma](#dharma). As long as the light of his [Dharma](#dharma) had not appeared, his having come would make no difference to us. It would be just as if he had never come at all.

On attaining total and perfect Buddhahood upon the [Vajra Seat](#vajra-seat), our Teacher exclaimed:

> I have found a [Dharma](#dharma) like [ambrosia](#ambrosia),  
Deep, peaceful, simple, uncompounded, radiant.  
If I explain it no-one will understand,  
So I shall stay here silent in the forest.

Accordingly, for seven weeks he did not teach, until [Brahma](#brahma) and [Indra](#indra) begged him to turn the [Wheel of Dharma](#wheel-of-dharma).

Furthermore, if those who hold the authentic teaching do not explain it, it is difficult for the [Dharma](#dharma) to be of any real benefit to beings. An example is the great [Smrtijnana](#smrtijnana) of India, who came to Tibet because his mother had been reborn there in one of the ephemeral [hells](#hell). His interpreter died on the journey, and [Smrtijnana](#smrtijnana), who was wandering around the province of Kham unable to speak a word of the language, became a shepherd and died there without having been of very much benefit to anyone. When [Jowo Atisa](#atisa) later arrived in Tibet and learned what had happened, he cried out: "How sad! Tibetans, your merit is weak! Nowhere in India, East or West, was there a [pandita](#pandita) better than [Smrtijnana](#smrtijnana)," and, placing his hands together, he wept.

For us, the [Buddha Sakyamuni](#sakyamuni) has turned the [Wheel of the Dharma](#wheel-of-dharma) on three levels and, manifesting an inconceivable number of forms according to the needs and capacities of those to be helped, leads disciples through the nine vehicles of his teaching to maturity and liberation.

**3. The teachings still exist**

Even during a [kalpa](#kalpa) in which a [Buddha](#buddha) has appeared and given teachings, once the time for those teachings to endure has come to an end and the authentic [Dharma](#dharma) he has taught disappears it is exactly the same as in a dark kalpa. The period between the disappearance of one [Buddha's](#buddha) teachings and the next [Buddha's](#buddha) teachings being given is described as "devoid of [Dharma](#dharma)." In fortunate places where beings have adequate [merit](#merit), [pratyekabuddhas](#pratyekabuddha) appear, but the doctrine is not taught or practiced.

These days we still have the teachings of the [Buddha Sakyamuni](#sakyamuni). Their degree of survival follows a tenfold sequence. First, there are three periods, each consisting of five hundred parts.<sup>[29](#29)</sup> During this time, there appears the "teaching of the heart of [Samantabhadra](#samantabhadra)," which is the *fruit*.<sup>[30](#30)</sup> Then comes three periods of five hundred parts for *accomplishment*.<sup>[31](#31)</sup> These are followed by three periods of five hundred parts for *transmission*. Finally, one period of five hundred parts arises when *only the symbols are retained*. Altogether, this makes ten periods, each of five hundred parts. At present we have reached the seventh or eighth period. We live in an age of increase in the five degenerations&mdash;those of lifespan, beliefs, emotions, time and beings. Nonetheless, the doctrine of transmission and realization does still exist. As it has not died out, we still possess the advantage of *having the [Dharma](#dharma) in its entirety*.

<details id="29"><summary>Note <sup>29</sup></summary>
Lit. "years," but this does not refer to precise units of time but to periods of growth or decline affected by various causes such as the appearance of a holy being or, conversely, the harmful influence of evil beings. DKR
</details>

<details id="30"><summary>Note <sup>30</sup></summary>
During the period immediately following the promulgation of the teachings, those who practice them attain the fruit almost straight away.
</details>

<details id="31"><summary>Note <sup>31</sup></summary>
"These separate one's mind from liberation and omniscience. When one of them occurs, it withers the shoot of enlightenment and cuts one off from the family of liberation." NT
</details><br>

**4. The teachings can be followed**

That the Doctrine is still present, however, is irrelevant unless you make use of it&mdash;just as the rising sun, although it lights up the whole world, does not make the slightest difference to a blind man. And just as the waters ofa  great lake cannot quench the thirst of a traveler arriving at its shore unless he actually drinks from them, the [Dharma](#dharma) of transmission and realization cannot infiltrate your mind by itself.

To enter the [Dharma](#dharma) just to protect yourself from sickness and negative influences in this life, or because you fear the sufferings of the three lower realms in future lives, is called "[Dharma](#dharma) as protection against fears," and is not the right way to set out on the path.

To enter the [Dharma](#dharma) merely to have food, clothing and sxo on in this life, or to obtain the pleasant reward of a divine or human rebirth in the next, is called "[Dharma](#dharma) as quest for excellence."

To enter the [Dharma](#dharma) understanding that the whole of [samsara](#samsara) has no meaning, striving to find a way to be free from it, is called "taking up the teaching by arriving at the starting point fo the path."

**5. There are spiritual friends who can teach us**

Even if you start practicing the [Dharma](#dharma), unless you have been accepted by a [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) it will be of no use. The *Condensed Transcendent Wisdom* says:

> The [Buddha](#buddha) and the teachings depend upon the [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend).  
Thus said the Conqueror, supreme embodiment of all good qualities.

The Buddha's teaching is immense, its transmissions are numerous, and it covers an inexhaustible range of topics. Without relying on the pith instructions of a teacher we would never know how to condense the essential points of all those teachings and put them into practice.

Once, when [Jowo Atisa](#atisa) was in Tibet, [Khu, Ngok and Drom](#khu-ngok-and-drom<sup>*</sup> asked him:

<sup>* [Atisa's](#atisa) three main disciples ([see glossary](#khu-ngok-and-drom))</sup>

"For someone to achieve liberation and complete omniscience, which is more important&mdash;the canonical scriptures and their commentaries, or the oral instructions of the teacher?"

"The teacher's instructions," [Atisa](#atisa) replied.

"Why?"

"Because when it comes to doing the practice&mdash;even if you can explain the whole *[Tripitaka](#tripitaka)* from memory and are very skilled in metaphysics&mdash;without the teacher's practical guidance you and the [Dharma](#dharma) will part company."

"So," they continued, "is the main point of the teacher's instructions to keep the [three vows](#three-vows) and to strive to do good with body, speech and mind?"

"That is not the slightest bit of use," [Atisa](#atisa) replied.

"How can that be?" they exclaimed.

"You may be able to keep the [three vows](#three-vows) perfectly, but unless you are determined to free yourself from the [three worlds](#three-worlds) of [samsara](#samsara) it just creates further causes of [samsara](#samsara). You may be able to strive day and night to do good with body, speech, and mind, but unless you know how to dedicate the merit to perfect enlightenment, two or three wrong thoughts are enough to destroy it entirely. You may be teachers and meditators, full of piety and learning, but unless your minds are turned away from the eight ordinary concerns, whatever you do will only be for this present life, and you will not encounter the path that helps for future lives."

This illustrates how important it is to be taken under the care of a teacher, a [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend)

---

Checking your own life and circumstances for each of the [eight freedoms](#1-reflecting-on-the-nature-of-freedom) and [ten advantages](#2-reflecting-on-the-particular-advantages-related-to-dharma), if you find that all these favorable conditions are present, you have what is known as "human life endowed with the eighteen freedoms and advantages." However, the Omniscient Dharma King [Longchenpa](#longchenpa), in his *Wish-granting Treasury*, specifies sixteen additional conditions which preclude any opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma)&mdash;[eight intrusive circumstances](#23-the-eight-intrusive-circumstances-that-leave-no-freedom-to-practice-the-dharma)<sup>[32](#32)</sup> and [eight incompatible propensities](#24-the-eight-incompatible-propensities-that-leave-no-freedom-to-practice-the-dharma)<sup>[33](#33)</sup>&mdash;under whose sway it is important not to fall. In his words:

<details id="32"><summary>Note <sup>32</sup></summary>
NT explains that these can crop up suddenly, between one session of practice and the next, or during a session, and destroy one or several of the eighteen freedoms and advantages, like a wolf entering a sheep fold and carrying off one or two of the eighteen sheep within.

These are [the eight incompatible propensities that leave no freedom](#24-the-eight-incompatible-propensities-that-leave-no-freedom-to-practice-the-dharma). 

#### 2.3 THE EIGHT INTRUSIVE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LEAVE NO FREEDOM TO PRACTICE THE DHARMA

**1. Strong five poisons**

People in whom the **[five poisons](#five-poisons)**&mdash;that is, [negative emotions](#negative-emotions) such as hatred for enemies, infatuation with friends and relatives, and so forth&mdash; **are extremely strong**, may wish from time to time that they could practice some kind of true [Dharma](#dharma). But the [five poisons](#five-poisons) are too strong, dominating their minds most of the time and preventing them from ever accomplishing the [Dharma](#dharma) properly.

**2. Too stupid**

Very stupid beings, lacking even the slightest glimmer of intelligence, might enter the [Dharma](#dharma) but, being unable to understand a single word of the teaching or its meaning, they will never be able to study it or reflect and meditate upon it.

**3. Led by false teacher**

Once people have been taken as **disciples by a false [spiritual friend](#spiritual-friend) who teaches the view and action in a perverted manner**, their minds will be led on to wrong paths and will not be in accord with the true [Dharma](#dharma).

**4. Too lazy**

People who want to learn the [Dharma](#dharma) but are **too lazy**, without even a trace of diligence, will never accomplish it because they are so ensnared in their own indolence and procrastination.

**5. Too many obscurations and negative actions**

Some people's **[obscurations](#obscurations) and [negative actions](#negative-action)** are such that, in spite of the effort they put into the [Dharma](#dharma), they fail to develop any of the right qualities in their minds. Their **backlog of [bad actions](#negative-action) has overwhelmed them**, and they will lose confidence in the teachings without perceiving that it is all due to their own past actions.

**6. Servants without autonomy**

Those who are **in servitude to someone else, and have lost their autonomy**, may want to take up [Dharma](#dharma); but the person who dominates them does not allow them to practice.

**7. Out of fear without conviction**

Some people take up [Dharma](#dharma) out of **fear for this present life&mdash;that they might lack food or clothing, or experience other afflictions. But since they have no deep conviction in the [Dharma](#dharma)**, they give themselves up to their old habits and get involved in things that are not [Dharma](#dharma).

**8. Imposters**

Others are **imposters** who, through a pretense of [Dharma](#dharma), try to win possessions, services and prestige. In front of others they assume the guise of practitioners, but in their minds they are only interested in this life, so they are far removed from the path of liberation.

These are [eight circumstances that render it impossible to continue practising the Dharma](#23-the-eight-intrusive-circumstances-that-leave-no-freedom-to-practice-the-dharma).

#### 2.4 THE EIGHT INCOMPATIBLE PROPENSITIES THAT LEAVE NO FREEDOM TO PRACTICE THE DHARMA

**1. Tightly bound to worldly commitments**

People who are tightly bound to their worldly commitments, wealth, pleasures, children, relatives, and so forth, are so preoccupied with the strenuous efforts entailed by these things that they have no time to practice the [Dharma](#dharma).

**2. Very depraved**

Some people lack any scrap of humanity, and their nature is so depraved that they are unable to improve their behavior. Even a genuine spiritual teacher would find it very difficult to set them on the noble path. As the sublime beings of the past said, "The abilities of a disciple can be shaped, but not hsi basic character."

**3. Uninterested in liberation from samsara or life's sufferings**

A person who feels not the slightest consternation either on hearing of lower rebirths and the ills of [samsara](#samsara), or in the face of this present life's sufferings, has no determination whatsoever to liberate himself from [samsara](#samsara), and therefore no reason to engage in [Dharma](#dharma) practice.

**4. No trust in the teacher or teachings**

To have no faith at all, either in the true [Dharma](#dharma) or in the teacher, shuts off any access to the teachings and bars entry to the path of liberation.

**5. Enjoy causing harm**

People who take pleasure in harmful or negative actions, and who fail to control their thoughts, words and deeds, are devoid of any noble qualities and have turned away from the [Dharma](#dharma).

**6. Uninterested in spiritual values and Dharma**

Some people are no more interested in spiritual values and [Dharma](#dhamra) than a dog in eating grass. Since they feel no enthusiasm for the [Dharma](#dharma), its qualities will never develop in their minds.

**7. Breakers of vows and commitments to bodhicitta**

Anyone who, having entered the Basic Vehicle, breaks their vows and commitment to bodhicitta, has nowhere else to go but the lower realms. They will not escape from states where there is no opportunity to practice the [Dharma](#dharma).

**8. Breakers of samaya commitments**

Anyone who, having entered the [Secret Mantra Vehicle](#secret-mantrayana), breaks their [samaya](#samaya) commitments to their teacher and spiritual brothers and sisters, will bring about their own ruin and theirs, destroying any prospect of accomplishments.

These are eight propensities that lead one away from the [Dharma](#dharma) and snuff out the lamp of liberation.

Before these sixteen factors that leave no opportunity for the practice have been carefully ruled out, people in these decadent times may look as if they hav all the [freedoms and advantages](#the-difficulty-of-finding-the-freedoms-and-advantages) and are true practitioners of the [Dharma](#dharma). However, the chieftain upon their throne and the [lama](#lama) beneath their parasol,<sup>[34](#34)</sup> the hermit in their mountain solitude, the person who has renounced the affairs of state, and anyone who might have a high opinion of their own worth&mdash;each may think they are practicing [Dharma](#dharma), but as long as they are under the sway of these additional limiting conditions, they are not on the true path.

So, before blindly assuming the forms of [Dharma](#dharma), check your own state carefully first to see whether or not you have all thirty-four aspects of the freedoms and advantages. If you do have them all, rejoice and reflect deeply on them over and over again. Remind yourself how, now that you have finally gained these freedoms and advantages that are so difficult to find, you are not going to squander them; whatever happens, you are going to practice the true [Dharma](#dharma). Should you find, however, that some aspects are missing, try to acquire them by whatever means may be possible.

At all times, you should take pains to examine carefully whether or not you have all elements of the freedoms and advantages. If you fail to check, and any one of those elements should be lacking, you will be missing the chance to practice the [Dharma](#dharma) truly. After all, even the execution of a single minor everyday task requires many mutually dependent materials and conditions to be brought together. Is it any wonder that the realization of our ultimate goal&mdash;the [Dharma](#dharma)&mdash;is impossible without the conjunction of many interconnected factors?

Imagine a traveler who wants to brew themself some tea. The making of tea involves many different elements&mdash;the pot, the water, the wood, the fire, and so on. Of these, just to light the fire alone is impossible without a flint, steel, some tinder, the traveler's hands and so forth. If just one thing is missing, the tinder for instance, then the fact that the traveler has everything else they need is of no use whatsoever. They simply do not have what it takes to make tea. In the same way, if even one element of the freedoms and advantages is missing, there is no chance at all of practicing the true [Dharma](#dharma).

If you check your own mind carefully, you will see that even the basic eight freedoms and ten advantages are very difficult to attain, and that to have all ten advantages is even rarer than to have all eight freedoms.

Someone born as a human, with all their faculties intact and in a central region, but who becomes involved in a lifestyle conflicting with the [Dharma](#dharma) and who has no faith in the Conqueror'rs teaching, only has three of the advantages. Were he to obtain either of the two others, he would still only have four. Now, to have a lifestyle which does not conflict at all with the [Dharma](#dharma) is extremely hard. If any of a person's thoughts, words and deeds are negative and his motives are for this life, then in fact, even if they have the reputation of a good and learned person, their lifestyle is in conflict with the [Dharma](#dharma).

The same applies to the five circumstantial advantages. If a [Buddha](#buddha) has come, has taught the [Dharma](#dharma) and the teachings still exist, yet a person has not entered the [Dharma](#dharma), that person has only three of those advantages. Here again, "entering the Dharma" does not simply mean asking for some teaching and being give in. The starting point of the path of liberation is the conviction that the whole of [samsara](#samsara) is meaningless and the genuine determination to be free from it. To travel the path of the [great-vehicle](#great-vehicle), the essential is to have genuinely aroused bodhicitta. The minimum is to have such unshakeable faith in the [Three Precious Jewels](#three-jewels) that you would never renounce them, even to save your life. Without that, simply reciting prayers and wearing yellow robes is no proof that you have entered the [Dharma](#dharma).

Make sure that you know how to identify each of these freedoms and advantages, and to check whether you have them yourself. This is of crucial importance.

### **3. Reflecting on images that show how difficult it is to find the freedoms and advantages**

The [Buddha](#sakyamuni) said that it is more difficult for a being to obtain human birth than it would be for a turtle coming up from the depths of the ocean to put its head by chance through the opening of a wooden yoke tossed around by huge waves on the surface.

Imagine the whole cosmos of a billion universes as a vast ocean. Floating upon it is a yoke, a piece of wood with a hole in it that can be fixed around the horns of draught oxen. this yoke, tossed hither and thither by the waves, sometimes eastward, sometimes westward, never stays in the same place even for an instant. Deep down in the depths of the ocean lives a blind turtle who rises up to the surface only once every hundred years.<sup>[35](#35)</sup> That the yoke and the turtle might meet is extremely unlikely. The yoke itself is inanimate; the turtle is not intentionally seeking it out. The turtle, being blind, has no eyes with which to spot the yoke. If the yoke were to stay in one place, there might be a chance of their meeting; but it is continually on the move. If the turtle were to spend its entire time swimming around the surface, it might, perhaps, cross paths with the yoke; but it surfaces only once every hundred years. The chances of the yoke and the turtle coming together are therefore extremely small. Nevertheless, by sheer chance the turtle might still just slip its neck into the yoke. But it is even more difficult than that, the [sutras](#sutra) say, to obtain a human existence with the freedoms and advantages. [Nagarjuna](#nagarjuna) expresses this in his *Advice to King Surabhibhadra*:<sup>[36](#36)</sup>

<details id="35"><summary>Note <sup>35</sup></summary>
"The ocean symbolizes the depth and vastness of the three lower realms of rebirth and their infinite sufferings. The blind turtle symbolizes the beings of these three worlds who are without the two eyes of adopting what is beneficial and abandoning what is harmful. The fact that the turtle only rises to the surface once every hundred years symbolizes the difficulty of escaping from those states. The one hole in the yoke symbolizes the rarity of human and celestial existences. The wind which propels it this way and that represents dependence on favorable circumstances."
</details>

<details id="36"><summary>Note <sup>36</sup></summary>
We have chosen 'Surabhibhadra' as one possible Sanskrit reconstruction of the Tibetan *bde spyod bzang po*, the name of the king for whom [Nagarjuna](#nagarjuna) wrote this text. In fact, although most accounts agree that he was a close friend and patron of [Nagarjuna](#nagarjuna), the king's identity in historical terms remains uncertain. He was probably of the Satavahana line of kings in Andhra, and while some scholars identify him with Guatamiputra Satakarni, who reigned at the beginning of the 2nd century A.D., others have called him Udayana or Udayi, or identified him with the kings Yajnasri or Vikramaditya.
</details><br>

> It is highly unlikely that a turtle might, by chance, arise through a yoke tossed about on a mighty sea;  
And yet, compared to animal birth there is far less chance than even that  
Of obtaining a human life. Accordingly, O Lord of Men,  
Practice the authentic Dharma to make your fortune fruitful!

And [Santideva](#santideva) says:

> The [Buddha](#sakyamuni) declared that like a turtle that perchance can place  
Its head within a yoke adrift upon a shoreless sea,  
This human birth is difficult to find.

The difficulty of obtaining human birth is also compared to that of getting dried peas thrown at a smooth wall to stick to it, or to that of balancing a pile of peas on the tip of an upright needle&mdash;which is hard enough with even one single pea! It is important to know these comparisons, which are from the *Nirvana Sutra*, and similar ones in other texts.

### **4. Reflecting on numerical comparisons**

When you consider the relative numbers of different kinds of beings, you can appreciate that to be born a human is hardly possible at all. By way of illustration, it is said that if the inhabitants of the [hells](#hell) were as numerous as stars in the night sky, the [pretas](#preta) would be no more numerous than the stars visible in the daytime; that if there were as many [pretas](#preta) as stars at night, there would only be as many animals as stars in the daytime; and that if there were as many animals as stars at night, there would only be as many gods and humans as stars in the daytime.

It is also said that there are as many beings in [hell](#hell) as specks of dust in the whole world, as many [pretas](#preta) as particles of sand in the Ganges, as many animals as grains in a beer-barrel<sup>[37](#37)</sup> and as many [asuras](#5-the-asuras) as snowflakes in a blizzard&mdash;but that [gods](#gods) and humans are as few a the particles of dust on a fingernail.

<details id="37"><summary>Note <sup>37</sup></summary>
This refers to a Tibetan beer prepared by pouring hot water over fermented grain. The barrel containing this preparation would thus be entirely full of grains.
</details><br>

To take form as any beings of the higher realms is already rare enough, but rarer still is a human life complete with all the freedoms and advantages. We can see for ourselves at any time how few human beings there are compared to animals. Think how many bugs live in a clod of earth in summertime, or ants in a single anthill&mdash; there are hardly that many humans in the whole world. But even within mankind, we can see that compared to all those people born in outlying regions where the teachings have never appeared, those born in places where the [Dharma](#dharma) has spread are exceedingly rare. And even among these, there are only a very few who have all the freedoms and advantages.

With all these perspectives in mind, you should be filled with joy that you really have all the freedoms and advantages complete.

---

A human life can be called a "***precious human life***" only when it is complete with all aspects of the freedoms and advantages, and from then onwards it truly becomes precious. But as long as any of those aspects are incomplete, then, however extensive your knowledge, learning and talent in ordinary things may be, you do not have a precious human life. You have what is called an **ordinary human life**, **merely human life**, **hapless human life**, **meaningless human life**, or **human life returning empty handed**. it is like failing  to use a wish-fulfilling gem despite holding it in your hands, or returning empty-handed from a land full of precious gold.

> To come across a precious jewel  
Is nothing compared to finding this precious human life.  
Look how those who are not saddened by [samsara](#samsara)  
Fritter life away!  
>  
> To win a whole kingdom  
Is nothing compared to meeting a perfect teacher.  
Look how those with no devotion  
Treat the teacher as their equal!  
>  
> To be given command of a province  
Is nothing compared to receiving the [Bodhisattva](#bodhisattva) vows.  
Look how those with no compassion  
Hurl their vows away!  
>  
> To rule over the universe  
Is nothing compared to receiving a [tantric](#tantric) [empowerment](#empowerment).  
Look how those who do not keep the [samayas](#samaya)  
Jettison their promises!  
>  
> To catch sight of the Buddha  
Is nothing compared to seeing the true nature of mind.  
Look how those with no determination  
Sink back into delusion!

These freedoms and advantages do not come by chance or coincidence. They are the result of an accumulation of [merit](#merit) and [wisdom](#wisdom) built up over many [kalpas](#kalpa). The great scholar [Trakpa Gyaltsen](#trakpa-gyaltsen) says:

> This free and favored human existence  
Is not the result of your resourcefulness.  
It comes from the [merit](#merit) you have accumulated.

To have obtained human life only to be wholly involved in [evil activities](#negative-action) without the least notion of [Dharma](#dharma) is to be lower than the lower realms. As [Jetsun Mila](#jetsun-mila) said to the hunter Gonpo Dorje:

> To have the freedoms and fortunes of human birth is usually said to be precious,  
But when I see someone like you it doesn't seem precious at all.

Nothing has as much power to drag you down to the lower realms as human life. What you do with it, right now, is up to you alone:

> Used well, this body is our raft to freedom.  
Used badly, this body anchors us to [samsara](#samsara).  
This body does the bidding of both [good](#positive-action) and [evil](#negative-action).

It is through the power of all the [merit](#merit) you have accumulated in the past that you have now obtained this human life complete with its eighteen freedoms and advantages. To neglect the one essential thing&mdash;the supreme [Dharma](#dharma)&mdash;and instead just spend your life acquiring food and clothes and indulging the eight ordinary concerns would be a a useless waste of those freedoms and advantages. How ineffectual to wait until death is upon you and then beat your breast with remorse! For you will have made the wrong choice, as it says in *The Way of the Bodhisattva*:

> Thus having found the freedoms of a human life,  
If I now fail to train myself in virtue,  
What greater folly could there ever be?  
How more could I betray myself?

This present life, therefore, is the turning-point at which you can choose between lasting good or lasting evil. If you do not make use of it right now to seize the citadel of the absolute nature within this lifetime, in lives to come it will be very hard to obtain such freedom again. Once you take birth in any of the forms of life in the lower realms, no idea of [Dharma](#dharma) will ever occur to you. Too bewildered to know what to do or what not to do, you will fall endlessly further and further to ever lower realms. So, telling yourself that now is the time to make an effort, meditate over and over again, applying the three supreme methods: **start with the thought of bodhicitta**, **do the practice itself without any conceptualization**, and **dedicate the merit at the end**.

As a measure of how much this practice has truly convinced us, we should be like [Geshe Chengawa](#chengawa-geshe), who spent all his time practicing and never even slept. [Geshe Tonpa](#tonpa-geshe) said to him: "You'd better rest, my son. You'll make yourself ill."

"Yes, I should rest," Chengawa replied. "But when I think how difficult it is to find the freedoms and advantages that we have, I have no time to rest." He recited nine hundred million mantras of Miyowa and did without sleep for the whole of his life. We should meditate until exactly that sort of conviction arises in our own minds.

> *Although I have won these freedoms, I am poor in Dharma, which is their essence.  
Although I have entered the Dharma, I waste time doing other things.  
Bless me and foolish beings like me  
That we may attain the very essence of the freedoms and advantages.*

# <div align="center">CHAPTER TWO<br><i>The impermanence of life</i></div>

> *Seeing this threefold world as a fleeting illusion,  
You have left this life's concerns behind like spittle in the dust.  
Accepting all hardships, you have followed in the footsteps of the masters of old.  
Peerless Teacher, at your feet I bow.*

The way to listen to the teaching is as described in [Chapter One](#chapter-onethe-difficulty-of-finding-the-freedoms-and-advantages). The actual subject matter consists of seven meditations:
1. the impermanence of the outer universe in which beings live,
2. the impermanence of the beings living in it,
3. the impermanence of holy beings,
4. the impermanence of those in positions of power,
5. other examples of impermanence
6. the uncertainty of the circumstances of death,
7. and intense awareness of impermanence.

## I. THE IMPERMANENCE OF THE OUTER UNIVERSE IN WHICH BEINGS LIVE

Our world, this outer environment fashioned by the collective good [karma](#karma) of beings, with its firm and solid structure encompassing the four continents<sup>[37.1](#37-1)</sup> and the heavenly realms, lasts for a whole [kalpa](#kalpa). It is nonetheless impermanent and will not escape final destruction by seven stages of fire and one of water.

As the present [great kalpa](#good-kalpa) draws closer to the time of destruction, the beings inhabiting each realm below the god-realm of the first meditative state will, realm by realm, progressively disappear until not a single being is left.

Then, one after the other, seven suns will rise in the sky. The first sun will burn up all fruit-bearing trees and forests. The second will evaporate all streams, creeks and ponds; the third will dry up all the rivers; and the fourth all the great lakes, even Manasarovar. As the fifth sun appears, the great oceans, too, will progressively evaporate at first to a depth of one hundred leagues, then of two hundred, seven hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, and finally eighty thousand leagues. The sea-water that is left will shrink from a league down to an ear-shot, until not even enough remains to fill a footprint. By the time there are six suns all blazing together, the entire earth and its snow-covered mountains will have burst into flames. And when the seventh appears, [Mount Meru](#meru-mount) itself will burn up, together with the four continents<sup>[37.1](#37-1)</sup>, the eight sub-continents,<sup>[37.1](#37-1)</sup> the seven golden mountains,<sup>[37.2](#37-2)</sup> and the circular wall of mountains at the world's very rim<sup>[37.3](#37-3)</sup>. Everything will fuse into one vast mass of fire. As it blazes downwards, it will consume all the infernal realms. As it flares upwards, it will engulf the celestial palace of Brahma, already long abandoned. Above, the younger gods of the realm of Clear Light will cry out in fear, "What an immense conflagration!" But the older gods will reassure them, saying "Have no fear! Once it reaches the world of Brahma, it will recede. This has happened before."<sup>*</sup>

<sup>* These stages of destruction all take place within one kalpa, but even these long-lived gods can grow old between the first destruction by fire and the seventh, after which their realm&mdash;part of that of the second concentration&mdash;will be destroyed by water.</sup>

<details id="37-1"><summary>Note <sup>37.1</sup></summary>
There are two subcontinents for each of the four continents which surround Mount Meru according to Buddhist cosmology. The subcontinents "are the same color and shape as their respective main continents and are half their size. The four continents and eight subcontinents are:  
<br>

1. Purvavideha in the East:  
- 1. Deha (T. lus) and  
- 2. Videha (T. lus 'phags)  

2. Jambudvipa in the South:  
- 3. Cāmara (T. rnga yab) and  
- 4. Aparacāmara (T. rnga yab gzhan)  

3. Aparagodaniya in the West:  
- 5. Shatha (Skt. Satha; T. g.yo ldan) and  
- 6. Uttaramantriṇa (T. lam mchog 'gro)  

4. Uttarakuru in the North:  
- 7. Kurava (T. sgra mi snyan) and  
- 8. Kaurava (T. sgra mi snyan gyi zla)

<details id="37-2"><summary>Note <sup>37.2</sup></summary>
Seven golden mountain rages (T. gser gyi ri bdun) are a group of mountain ranges that surround Mount Meru, according to Buddhist cosmology.<br>

The names of these mountain ranges are:<br>

1. Yoke (Yugandhara; T. gnya' shing 'dzin)
2. Plough (Iṣadhara; T. gshol mda' 'dzin)
3. Forest of Acacia Trees (Khadiraka; T. seng ldeng can)
4. Pleasing (Sudarsana; T. lta na sdug)
5. Horse Ear (Asvakarna; T. rta rna)
6. Bent (Vinataka; T. rnam 'dud)
7. Rim (Nimindhara; T. mu khyud 'dzin)

The first range of mountains, Yugandhara, is a quarter of the height of Mount Meru. Each of the subsequent mountain ranges are half the height of the previous ones.  

Jamgon Kongtrul states:  

> Beyond Mount Meru and completely surrounding it like curtains are seven mountain ranges, each forming a square. These seven golden mountain ranges [are named according to the shape of their peaks]: Yoke, Plough, Acacia Forest, Pleasing-to-the-Eye, Horse's Ear, Bent and Rim.  
>  
> The spaces between [the mountain ranges] are filled with what are known as seven seas enjoyed [by the nagas], the waters of which have eight qualities: cool, tasty, light, soft, clear, odorless, harmless to the throat if swallowed, and harmless to the stomach.

Dudjom Rinpoche states:  

> Mount Meru is surrounded by seven golden mountain ranges disposed like screens in a square around it&mdash;Yugandhara, Ishadhara, Khadiraka, Sudarsana, Ashvakarna, Vinataka, and Nimindhara—each range being half the height of the previous one. These mountain ranges are separated from each other by the Seas of Enjoyment, whose waters have the eight perfect qualities described in the Vinaya scriptures:
>  
>  > Cool, sweet, light, and soft,  
Clear and odorless,  
And not irritant to the throat&mdash;  
Such is water that has the eight perfect qualities.
>  
> They are filled with wish-fulfilling jewels and the other multifarious riches that belong to the nagas.
>  
> Outside the seven golden mountain ranges are the four great continents, whose colors correspond to those of the four sides of Mount Meru.

Description of the Universe<br>
Abhidharma<br><br>

A world system has a square Core Mountain (Mount Meru) surrounded by seven concentric rings of fresh water seas and lesser golden mountains. Beyond the seventh ring of mountains lie four oceans, one in each cardinal direction, with an island-world (continent) in the middle of each ocean. These oceans constitute the eighth sea. Beyond each continent lie two smaller isles (subcontinents), with the entire configuration surrounded by an ***outer eighth ring of black iron mountains***...

...As for the eight rings of mountains on the gold base, the seven closest to Mount Meru are actual mountains, while the eighth is an iron fence encircling the perimeter of the entire gold base...

After seven such destructions by fire, rainclouds will form in the realm of the gods of the second concentration, and a yoke's depth of torrential rain will fall, followed by a plough's depth. Like salt dissolving in water, everything up to and including the realm of the gods of the Clear Light will disintegrate.

After the seventh such devastation by water is over, the crossed vajra of wind at the base of the universe will rise up. Like dust scattered by the wind, everything up to and including the realm of the gods of the third meditative concentration will be blown completely away.

Reflect deeply and sincerely&mdash;if every one of the billion universes which constitute the cosmos, each with its own [Mount Meru](#meru-mount), four continents and heavens, is to be simultaneously destroyed in this way, leaving only space behind, however could these human bodies of ours, which are like flies at the end of the season, have any permanence or stability?

## II. THE IMPERMANENCE OF BEINGS LIVING IN THE UNIVERSE

From the summit of the highest heavens to the very depths of hell, there is not a single being who can escape death. As the *Letter of Consolation* says:

> Have you ever, on earth or in the heavens,  
Seen a being born who will not die?  
Or heard that such a thing had happened?  
Or even suspected that it might?

Everything that is born is bound to die. Nobody has ever seen anyone or heard of anyone in any realm&mdash;even in the world of the gods&mdash;who was born but never died. In fact, it never even occurs to us to wonder whether a person will die or not. It is a certainty. Especially for us, born as we are at the end of an era<sup>*</sup> in a world where the length of life is unpredictable, death will come soon. It gets closer and closer from the moment we are born. Life can only get shorter, never longer. Inexorably, death closes in, never pausing for an instant, like the shadow of a mountain at sunset.

<sup>* The end of an era is a period of decline in which life is more fragile.</sup>

Do you know for sure when you will die, or where? Might it be tomorrow, or tonight? Can you be sure that you are not going to die right now, between this breath and the next? As it says in *The Collection of Deliberate Sayings*:

> Who's sure they'll live till tomorrow?  
Today's the time to be ready,  
For the legions of Death  
Are not on our side.

And [Nagarjuna](#nagarjuna), too, says:

> Life flickers in the flurries of a thousand ills,  
More fragile than a bubble in a stream.  
In sleep, each breath departs and is again drawn in;  
How wondrous that we wake up living still!

Breathing gently, people enjoy their slumber. But between one breath and the next there is no guarantee that death will not slip in. To wake up in good health is an event which truly deserves to be considered miraculous, yet we take it completely for granted.

Although we know that we are going to die one day, we do not really let our attitudes to life be affected by the ever-present possibility of dying. We still spend all our time hoping and worrying about our future livelihood, as if we were going to live forever. We stay completely involved in our struggle for well-being, happiness and status&mdash;until, suddenly, we are confronted by Death wielding its black noose, gnashing ferociously at its lower lip and baring its fangs.

Then nothing can help us. No soldier's army, no ruler's decrees, no rich man's wealth, no scholar's brilliance, no beauty's charms, no athlete's fleetness&mdash;none is of any use. We might seal ourselves inside an impenetrable, armored metal chest, guarded by hundreds of thousands of strong men bristling with sharp spears and arrows; but even that would not afford so much as a hair's breadth of protection or concealment. Once the Lord of Death secures its black noose around our neck, our face begins to pale, our eyes glaze over with tears, our head and limbs go limp, and we are dragged willy-nilly down the highway to the next life.

Death cannot be fought off by any warrior, ordered away by the powerful, or paid off by the rich. Death leaves nowhere to run to, no place to hide, no refuge, no defender or guide. Death resists any recourse to skill or compassion. Once our life has run out, even if the [Medicine Buddha](#medicine-buddha) themself were to appear in person they would be unable to delay our death.

So, reflect sincerely and meditate on how important it is from this very moment onwards never to slip into laziness and procrastination, but to practice the true [Dharma](#dharma), the only thing you can be sure will help at the moment of death.

## III. THE IMPERMANENCE OF HOLY BEINGS

In the present [Good Kalpa](#good-kalpa), [Vipasyin](#vipasyin), [Sikhin](#sikhin) and five other [Buddhas](#buddha) have already appeared, each with their own circle of [Sravakas](#sravaka) and [Arhats](#arhat) in inconceivable number. Each worked to bring benefit to innumerable beings through the teachings of the [Three Vehicles](#three-vehicles). Yet nowadays all we have is whatever still remains of the [Buddha Sakyamuni's](#sakyamuni) teaching. Otherwise, all of those [Buddhas](#buddha) have passed into [nirvana](#nirvana) and all the pure [Dharma](#dharma) teachings they gave have gradually disappeared.

One by one, the numerous great [Sravakas](#sravaka) of the present dispensation too, each with their entourage of five hundred [Arhats](#arhat), have passed beyond suffering into the state where nothing is left of the aggregates.

In India, there once lived the [Five Hundred Arhats](#five-hundred-arhats) who compiled the words of the [Buddha](#sakyamuni). There were the Six Ornaments and Two Supreme Ones, the Eighty Siddhas, and many others, who mastered all attributes of the paths and levels and possessed unlimited clairvoyance and miraculous powers. But all that remains of them today are the stories telling how they lived.

Here too in Tibet, the Land of Snows, when the [Second Buddha](#second-buddha) of Oddiyana<sup>*</sup> turned the [Wheel of Dharma](#wheel-of-dharma) to ripen and liberate beings, there lived all his followers, like the [twenty-five disciples](#twenty-five-disciples) known as the King and Subjects and the Eighty Siddhas of Yerpa. Later came the [Ancient Tradition](#ancient-tradition) masters of the So, Zur and Nub clans; [Marpa](#mara), [Milarepa](#milarepa) and Dagpo of the [New Tradition](#new-tradition); and innumerable other learned and accomplished beings. Most of them achieved high levels of accomplishment and had mastery over the four elements. They could produce all sorts of miraculous transformations. They could make tangible objects appear out of nowhere and disappear into nowhere. They could not be burned by fire, be swept away by water, be crushed by earth or fall from precipices into space&mdash;they were simply free from any harm that the [four elements](#four-elements) could bring about.

<sup>* [Padmasambhava](#padmasambhava-of-oddiyana) is often referred to as the second [Buddha](#buddha) of our era, extending the work of [Sakyamuni](#sakyamuni).</sup><br>

Once, for example, [Jetsun Milarepa](#jetsun-mila) was meditating in silence in Nyeshangkatya cave in Nepal when a band of hunters passed by. Seeing him sitting there, they asked him whether he was a man or a ghost. [Milarepa](#milarepa) remained motionless, his gaze fixed before him, and did not answer. The hunters shot a volley of poisoned arrows at him, but none of their arrows managed to pierce his skin. They threw him into the river, and then over the edge of a cliff&mdash;but each time there he was again, sitting back where he had been before. Finally, they piled firewood around him and set it alight, but the fire would not burn him. There have been many beings who attained such powers. But in the end, they all chose to demonstrate that everything is impermanent,<sup>**</sup> and today all that remains of them is their stories.

<sup>** Such beings are considered to be beyond birth and death. However, like the [Buddha Sakyamuni](#sakyamuni), they choose to die nonetheless to remind beings of impermanence.</sup><br>

As for us, our [negative actions](#negative-action), carried along by the wind of negative conditions in the prevailing direction of our negative tendencies, have driven us here into this filthy contraption made up of the four material elements, in which we are trapped and upon which our sentient existence depends&mdash;and as we can never be sure when or where this scarecrow of an illusory body is going to disintegrate, it is important that from this very moment onwards we inspire ourselves to thoughts, words and deeds which are always positive. With this in mind, [meditate](#meditate-meditation) on impermanence.

## IV. THE IMPERMANENCE OF THOSE IN POSITIONS OF POWER

There are magnificent and illustrious [gods](#gods) and [risis](#risi) who can live for as long as a [kalpa](#kalpa), with statures measured in leagues or earshots and a power and resplendence that outshine the sun and moon, are nevertheless not beyond the reach of death. As *The Treasury of Qualities* says:

> Even [Brahma](#brahma), [Indra](#indra), Mahesvara and the universal monarchs  
Have no way to evade the Demon of Death.

In the end, not even divine or human [risis](#risi) with the [five kinds of clairvoyance](#five-clairvoyances) and the power to fly through the sky can escape death. *The Letter of Consolation* says"

> Great [risis](#risi) with their [five-fold powers](#five-clairvoyances)  
Can fly far and wide in the skies,  
Yet they will never reach a land  
Where immortality holds sway.

Here in our human world there have been universal emperors who have reached the very pinnacle of power and material wealth. In the holy land of India, starting with [Mahasammata](#mahasammata), innumerable emperors ruled the entire continent. Later the three Palas, the thirty-seven Candras and many other rich and powerful kings reigned in both eastern and western India.

In Tibet, the Land of Snows, the first king, Nyatri Tsenpo, was of divine descent, an emanation of the Bodhisattva Nivaranaviskambhin. Then reigned the seven heavenly kings called Tri, the six earthly kings called Lek, the eight middle kings called De, the five linking kings called Tsen, the twelve and a half<sup>[38](#38)</sup> kings of the Fortunate Dy nasty including the five of the Extremely Fortunate Dynasty, and others besides. In the reign of the Dharma King [Songtsen Gampo](#songtsen-gampo), a magical army subdued all lands from Nepal to China. King [Trisong Detsen](#trisong-detsen) brought two thirds of [Jambudvipa](#jambudvipa)<sup>*</sup> under his power, and, during the reign of Ralpachen, an iron pillar was erected on the banks of the Ganges, marking the frontier between India and Tibet. Tibet exercised power in many regions of India, China, Gesar, Tajikistan and other countries. At the New Year festival, ambassadors from all those countries were required to spend one day in Lhasa. Such was Tibet's power in the past. But it did not last, and nowadays, apart from the historical accounts, nothing is left.

<sup>* Here this term would seem to refer to South Asia, Mongolia and China.</sup>

<details id="38"><summary>Note <sup>38</sup></summary>
The "half" refers to the reign of Mune Tsenpo, who died after reigning for only one year and nine months.
</details><br>

Reflect on those past splendors. Compared to them, our own homes, belongings, servants, status, and whatever else we prize, seem altogether no more significant than a beehive. [Meditate](#meditate-meditation) deeply, and ask yourself how you could have thought that those things would last forever and never change.

## V. OTHER EXAMPLES OF IMPERMANENCE

As an example of impermanence, consider the cycle of growth and decline that takes place over a [kalpa](#kalpa). Long ago, in the first age of this [kalpa](#kalpa), there were no sun and moon in the sky and all human beings were lit up by their own intrinsic radiance. They could move miraculously through space. They were several leagues tall. The fed on divine [nectar](#nectar) and enjoyed perfect happiness and well-being, matching that of the [gods](#gods). Gradually, however, under the influence of [negative emotions](#negative-emotions) and [wrong-doing](#negative-action), the human race slowly degenerated to its present state. Even today, as those emotions become ever more gross, human lifespan and good fortune are still on the decrease. This process will continue until humans live no more than ten years. Most of the beings living in the world will disappear during periods of plague, war and famine. Then , to the survivors, and emanation of the [Buddha Maitreya](#maitreya) will preach abstinence from killing. At that time, humans will only be one cubit tall. From then on their lifespan will increase to twenty years and then gradually become longer and longer until it reaches eighty thousand years. At that point Lord [Maitreya](#maitreya) will appear in person, become [Buddha](#buddha) and turn the [Wheel of the Dharma](#wheel-of-dharma). When eighteen such cycles of growth and decline have taken place and human beings live an incalculable number of years, the Buddha Infinite Aspiration will appear and live for as long as all the other thousand [Buddhas](#buddha) of the [Good Kalpa](#good-kalpa) put together. The Buddha Infinite Aspiration's activities for beings' welfare, too, will match all of theirs put together. Finally this [kalpa](#kalpa) will end in destruction. Examining such changes, you can see that even on this vast scale nothing is beyond the reach of impermanence.

Watching the four seasons change, also, you can see how everything is impermanent. In summertime the meadows are green and lush from the nectar of summer showers, and all living beings bask in a glow of well-being and happiness. Innumerable varieties of flowers spring up and the whole landscape blossoms into a heavenly paradise of white and gold, scarlet and blue. Then, as the autumn breezes grow cooler, the green grasslands change hue. Fruit and flowers, one by one, dry up and wither. Winter soon sets in, and the whole earth becomes as hard and brittle as rock. Ponds and rivers freeze solid and glacial winds scour the landscape. You could ride for days on end looking for all those summer flowers and never see a single one. And so comes each season in turn, summer giving way to autumn, autumn to winter and winter to spring, each different from the one before, and each just as ephemeral. Look how quickly yesterday and today, this morning and tonight, this year and next year, all pass by one after the other. Nothing ever lasts, nothing is dependable.

Think about your village or monastic community, or wherever you live. People who not long ago were prosperous and secure now suddenly find themselves heading for ruin; others, once poor and helpless, now speak with authority and are powerful and wealthy. Nothing stays the same forever. In your own family, each successive generation of parents, grandparents and great-grandparents have all died, one by one. They are only names to you now. And as their time came many brothers, sisters and other relatives have died too, and no-one knows where they went or where they re now. Of the powerful, rich and prosperous people who only last year were the most eminent in the land, many this year are already just names. Who knows whether those whose present wealth and importance makes them the envy of ordinary folk will still be in the same position this time next year&mdash;or even next month? Of your own domestic animals&mdash;sheep, goats, dogs&mdash;how many have died in the past and how many are still alive? When you think about what happens in all of these cases, you can see that nothing stays the same forever. Of all the people who were alive more than a hundred years ago, not a single one has escaped death. And in another hundred years from now, every single person now alive throughout the world will be dead. Not one of them will be left.

There is therefore absolutely nothing in the universe, animate or inanimate, that has any stability or permanence.

> Whatever is born is impermanent and is bound to die.  
Whatever is stored up is impermanent and is bound to run out.  
Whatever comes together is impermanent and is bound to come apart.  
Whatever is built is impermanent and is bound to collapse.  
Whatever rises up is impermanent and is bound to fall down.  
So also, friendship and enmity, fortune and sorrow, good and evil,  
all the thoughts that run through your mind&mdash;everything is always changing.

You might be as exalted as the heavens, as mighty as a thunderbolt, as rich as a [naga](#naga), as good-looking as a [god](#gods) or as pretty as a rainbow&mdash;but no matter who or what you are, when death suddenly comes there is nothing you can do about it for even a moment. You have no choice but to go, naked and cold, your empty hands clenched stiffly under your armpits. Unbearable though it might be to part with your money, your cherished possessions, your friends, loved ones, attendants, disciples, country, lands, subjects, property, food, drink and wealth, you just have to leave everything behind, like a hair being pulled out of a slab of butter.<sup>*</sup> You might be the head [lama](#lama) over thousands of monks, but you cannot take even one of them with you. You might be governor over tens of thousands of people, but you cannot take a single one as your servant. All the wealth in the world would still not give you the power to take as much as a needle and thread.

<sup>* The butter does not stick to the hair. Only the empty impression of the hair remains.</sup><br>

Your dearly beloved body, too, is going to be left behind. This same body that was wrapped up during life in silk and brocades, that was kept well filled up with tea and beer, and that once looked as handsome adn distinguished as a [god](#gods), is now called a corpse, and is left lying there horribly livid, heavy and distorted. Says [Jetsun Mila](#jetsun-mila):

> This thing we call a corpse, so fearful to behold,  
Is already right here&mdash;our own body.

Your body is trussed up with a rope and covered with a curtain, held in place with earth and stones. Your bowl is turned upside down on your pillow. No matter how precious and well loved you were, now you arouse horror and nausea. When the living lie down to sleep, even on piles of furs and soft sheepskin rugs, they start to feel uncomfortable after a while and have to keep turning over. But once you are dead, you just lie there with your cheek against a stone or tuft of grass, your hair bespattered with earth.

Some of you who are heads of families or clan chiefs might worry about the people under your care. Once you are no longer there to look after them, might they not easily die of hunger or cold, be murdered by enemies, or drown in the river? Does not all their wealth, comfort and happiness depend on you? in fact, however after your death they will feel nothing but relief at having managed to get rid of y our corpse by cremating it, throwing it into a river, or dumping it in the cemetery.

When you die, you have no choice but to wander all alone in the intermediate state without a single companion. At that time your only refuge will be the [Dharma](#dharma). So tell yourself again and again that from now on you must make the effort to accomplish at least one practice of genuine [Dharma](#dharma).

Whatever is stored up is bound to run out. A king might rule the whole world and still end up as a vagabond. Many start their life surrounded by wealth and end it starving to death, having lost everything. People who had herds of hundreds of animals one year can be reduced to beggary the next by epidemics or heavy snow, and someone who was rich and powerful only the day before might suddenly find themself asking for alms because their enemies have destroyed everything they own. That all these things happen is something you can see for yourself; it is impossible to hang on to your wealth and possessions forever. Never forget that generosity is the most important capital to build up.<sup>*</sup>

<sup>* i.e. a capital of [merit](#merit). This concept is explained in Part Two, [Chapter 4](#chapter-fouroffering-the-mandala-to-accumulate-merit-and-wisdom)</sup><br>

No coming together can last forever. It will always end in separation. We are like inhabitants of different places gathering in thousands and even tens of thousands for a big  market or an important religious festival, only to part again as each returns home. Whatever affectionate relationships we now enjoy&mdash;teachers and disciples, masters and servants, patrons and their proteges, spiritual comrades, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives&mdash;there is no way we can avoid being separated in the end. We cannot even be sure that death or some other terrible event might not suddenly part us right now. Since spiritual companions, couples and so forth might be split up unexpectedly at any moment, we had better avoid anger and quarrels, harsh words and fighting. We never know how long we might be together, so we should make up our minds to be caring and affectionate for the short while that we have left. As [Padampa Sangye](#padampa-sangye) says:

> Families are as fleeting as a crowd om market-day;  
People of Tingri, don't bicker or fight!

Whatever buildings are constructed are bound to collapse. Villages and monasteries that were once successful and prosperous now lie empty and abandoned, and where once their careful owners lived, now only birds make their nests. Even [Samye's](#samye) central three-storeyed temple, built by miraculously emanated workers during the reign of King [Trisong Detsen](#trisong-detsen) and consecrated by the [Second Buddha](#second-buddha) of Oddiyana, was destroyed by fire in a single night. The Red Mountain Palace that existed in King [Songtsen Gampo's](#songtsen-gampo) time rivalled the palace of Indra himself, but now not even the foundation stones are left. In comparison, our own present towns, houses and monasteries are just so many insects' nests. So why do we attach such importance to them? It would be better to set our hearts on following to the very end the example of the [Kagyupas](#kagyupa) of old, who left their homeland behind and headed for the wilderness. They dwelt at the foot of rocky cliffs with only wild animals for companions, and, without the least concern about food, clothing or renown, embraced the four basic aims of the [Kadampas](#kadampa):

2. The demon of [negative emotions](#negative-emotions), *nyon mongs pa'i bdud*, the causer of death. (These emotions, which arise from the belief in a self, give rise to [negative actions](#negative-action). Negative actions give rise to [karma](#karma) and it is due to karma that we helplessly are born and die.)
3. The demon of the Lord of Death, *'chi bdag gi bdud*, which is death itself. (This means death as such, which inevitably follows birth. More subtly it is the natural impermanence of each moment, which is by nature painful.)
4. The demon of the sons of the [gods](#gods), *lha'i bu yi bdud*, that which prevents us from proceeding towards the state of peace beyond death. (In practice it refers to distraction, thoughts of attachment to external objects.)

"According to the [Mantrayana](#secret-mantrayana) [vehicle](#vehicle), the four demons are:

1. The tangible demon: exterior things and beings which harm our body and mind.
2. The intangible demon: attachment, aversion and confusion and the 84,000 types of [negative emotions](#negative-emotions) that give rise to all the sufferings of [samsara](#samsara).
3. The demon of exultation: this means the exultation that one feels when one thinks that one's own spiritual teacher, the teachings one has received and the practices one is engaged in are different, and that one's own vajra brothers and sisters are superior to other people's. More particularly, it is the infatuation that one feels when one achieves the slightest 'warmth' or power of the practice.
4. The demon of conceit is the root of the three others: it is the belief in 'I' and 'mine;' this conceit makes us take the five aggregates as 'me' or 'mine:' if one destroys this demon, all external demons are destroyed by themselves, without doing anything to destroy them."
